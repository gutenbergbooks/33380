<h2>Love's Usuries.</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>"The star of love is a flower&mdash;a deathless token,<br />
That grows beside the gate of unseen things."</p></div>


<p>Among friends, parting for a lengthy spell has
its disadvantages. They age in character and
physique, and after the reconnoitre there is a
pathetic consciousness of the grudging confessions
which time has inscribed on the
monumental palimpsest. My meeting with
Bentham after a severance of years was bleak
with this pathos. But he was gay as ever,
and better dressed than he used to be in the
old art school days, with a self-respecting
adjustment of hat and necktie that had been
unknown in Bohemia; for he was no longer a
boy, but a man, and a noted one, and fortune
had stroked him into sleekness. The gender of
success must be feminine: she is so capricious.
Hitherto her smiles have been for veterans<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
grown hoary in doing; now she opens her
arms for youngsters grown great merely by
daring. Bentham, it must be owned, had
dared uncommonly well, and success had
pillowed his head in her lap while she twined
the bay with her fingers. But lines round his
mouth and fatigued cynicism on the eyelids
betrayed the march of years, and, more, the
thinker, who, like most thinkers, plumbs to
exhaustion in a bottomless pit. For all that
he was excellent company. On his walls
hung innumerable trophies of foreign travel
and unique specimens of his own art-bent and
with these, by gesture or by anecdote, he
gave an unconscious synopsis of the skipped
pages in our friendship's volume.</p>

<p>"This," he said, "is the original of 'Earth's
Fair Daughters,' the canvas that brought me
to the front; and here"&mdash;handing an album&mdash;"is
the presentment of my benefactress."</p>

<p>"Benefactress?" I queried.</p>

<p>"Yes. I don't attempt to pad you with the
social tarra-diddle that genius finds nuggets
on the surface of the diggings. Fame was
due to myself, and fortune to Mrs Brune&mdash;a
dear old creature who bought my pictures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
with a persistence worthy a better cause.
She died, leaving me her sole heir."</p>

<p>"And hence these travels?"</p>

<p>"Yes. When I lost sight of you in Paris
I hewed a new route to notice. I played at
being successful, bought my own pictures
through dealers&mdash;<i>incog.</i>, of course&mdash;at enormous
prices. That tickled the ears of the
Press."</p>

<p>"But how about commission?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the dealers earned it, and my money
was well invested. I became talked about.
The public knew nothing of my talent, and
people love to talk of what they understand
least."</p>

<p>"You belittle yourself, Bentham. You felt
your work was sound&mdash;that you were bound
to become great."</p>

<p>"True; otherwise I could not have stooped
to play the charlatan. Without it my work
might as well have been rotten for all the
public could judge. Charlatanism is the only
'open sesame' to the world's cave, once you
get inside you may be as honest as you please.
All is fair in love or art or war, and there is
a consolation in knowing that one's aim is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
Jesuitical, and not merely base. Had it not
been for Mrs Brune&mdash;good soul&mdash;and the
gambling instinct, I might be still, like you
and Grey's 'gem of purest ray serene,' flashing
my facets in the desert."</p>

<p>From Mrs Brune's portrait he devolved on
one or two others of persons distinguished
in the art sphere, whose autographs, with
cordial or extravagant expressions of devotion,
scrambled octopus-wise over the card.</p>

<p>"And here," he said, handling an album
bound in chicken skin, adorned with the grace
of Watteau's rurality&mdash;"here are my Flower
Martyrs."</p>

<p>"What does that mean?" asked I, knowing
him for an eccentric of eccentrics.</p>

<p>"Don't you remember the quotation,
'Butchered to make a Roman holiday?' It
struck me once I should like to make an index
of the flower lives that had been sacrificed on
the Altar of Selfishness."</p>

<p>"And this is the index?"</p>

<p>"No, not exactly. I soon tired of the
experiment, for there was such wholesale
murder it was impossible to keep pace with it.
I then confined myself to the martyrs, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
veritable martyrs broken on the rack of
human emotion. Here are a few&mdash;with
remarks and dates&mdash;they have each a little
history of love or heroism or&mdash;&mdash;" he shuffled
for a term.</p>

<p>"Lunacy," I offered.</p>

<p>"Yes, that is the best word. They convey
little histories of lunacy&mdash;my own and others."</p>

<p>"May I inspect them?"</p>

<p>"You may," he conceded, throwing himself
into an arm-chair and looking over his elbow
at the open page. "First," he said, "some
rose leaves." He coughed slightly, and stirred
the fire with caution, as though it shaped some
panorama he feared to disarrange. Then he
began his story:&mdash;</p>

<p>"First some rose leaves shaken into the
finger-glass of a great actress&mdash;you know
Lalage?&mdash;on the night when all Paris was
intoxicated by her. It was my supper, and
she honoured me. Many men would gladly
have been that rose&mdash;to lay down its life for
a touch of her finger-tips: several have
parted with all that life holds dear for less
than that."</p>

<p>He struck a match and lit a cigarette,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
throwing the case to me, and then
proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The bowls were fragrant with attar, and
those petals like fairy boats skimmed over the
scented surface of the water. They seemed
very red then, but they are faded enough
now."</p>

<p>He again stared at the fire as though to
assist his memory by its pictures.</p>

<p>"Lalage is a great artist, and like all great
artists her contact brings completeness and
a sense of fulfilment to everything&mdash;colour,
purpose, expression. I had just heard her in
the <i>role</i> of Chimene, in the wonderful scene
when, not daring to avow her love for
Rodrigue, she should have uttered '<i>Va-je ne te
hais point</i>,' and where she merely stood with
moving lips&mdash;powerless to articulate from the
suppressed immensity of her passion. We, of
the audience, by one consent seemed to shiver&mdash;to
shudder as though a polar breeze had
swept over the tropic night&mdash;so tragic, so real,
so ardent, this unspeakable, this unspoken
confession."</p>

<p>"And what of Mons. Redan?" I questioned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"The Count that turned actor? He played
the part of Rodrigue, and he told me afterwards
that there were times when a sob would
choke him as he listened."</p>

<p>"And Redan loved her?"</p>

<p>"Loved? Oh, pale, an&aelig;mic, wan-complexioned
word to run in leash with Redan.
He loved her so much that he was willing
to barter name, possessions, career for the
warmth of her lips."</p>

<p>"And she?"</p>

<p>"And she&mdash;&mdash;" he said, suddenly disturbing
his fire panorama with a dash of the poker.
"Well, she took them."</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment or two as I
turned the page&mdash;silence that was accentuated
by the falling ash, which dropped white and
weightless like the thousand lives that sink
daily to dust exhausted with hope deferred.
Then he eyed the vegetable mass that faced
me.</p>

<p>"A camellia," he explained, "crushed and
brown. It was plucked from the dead breast
of a woman. It was the solitary witness of
the last act of a tragedy. The Prince K. was
more than a kind patron&mdash;an almost friend to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
me. He valued my apprehension of art, and
shadowed me from the hour I first began to
paint little Gretchen carrying her father's
cobblings to their owners. He bought the
picture, and ceaselessly employed me to make
sketches of her in some way or another&mdash;as a
queen&mdash;as a boy&mdash;as a <i>danseuse</i>. He loved
to see her in all disguises, for she had the true
model's faculty for lending herself to, and
developing every pose. Then came the question
of marriage&mdash;it is inevitable when a man
meets a girl with eyes like altar lights, clear
and holy beacons of God. Marriage, between
a prince of the blood and the child of a shoemaker!"</p>

<p>Bentham gave vent to a low laugh, which
was quite devoid of merriment. It is the
trick of those who spend their lives in
plumbing the unfathomable; it translates the
meagreness and vacuity of their lore.</p>

<p>"Of course the family was outraged," he
went on; "his mother appealed, grovelled on
her knees, so it is said, and in the end he gave
way. He agreed to part from his beloved.
But he asked that she might sit for me, and
would sometimes muse for hours over the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
latest travail of my brush. Then he became
engaged to the Countess Dahlic&mdash;there is no
accounting for the moral weakness of men
under family pressure&mdash;and the wedding day
was fixed. All this time he had kept his
word. He had never spoken to or seen
Gretchen, and she, poor child, was dying&mdash;yes,
dying slowly&mdash;not as we die, but fading
like twilight, imperceptibly, fainting like high
purpose, blighted by the coarse breath of the
million."</p>

<p>He knocked the end off his cigarette
and stared for a while at the gas-smoked
ceiling.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;one day when the marriage was
close at hand, when flags hung from the housetops
and garlands across the streets, there
was a stir in the house of the cobbler.
Gretchen had been sitting to me as a Spanish
maid in a mantilla, with a camellia in her hair
and on her chest. Dressed so, she was found
locked in the arms of the Prince. Both were
dead&mdash;and the camellia was crushed to brown
as you see. It came into my possession with
the lace which belonged to me&mdash;an art
property that is now too entangled with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
human and with the divine ever to be used
lightly again."</p>

<p>"A sad story," I sighed, turning the leaf.
"Poor child, so young and pretty and&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Good," he added. "It is astonishing to
calculate the amount of virtue which lurks
about unlabelled by the wedding ring."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"That," he said, turning over a fresh page,
"was once a bunch of violets; it should have
belonged to Jacquaine."</p>

<p>"Who was Jacquaine?"</p>

<p>"She was a romantic creature, full of music
and passionate inspiration; but she had one
fault, that of inventing ideals. Don't you find
that most women come to grief over this
pastime?"</p>

<p>He scarcely demanded a reply, but went on
as though thinking aloud.</p>

<p>"She made a deity of her husband, who was
a clever 'cellist, but merely a man. When he
became dazzled with a vulgar, opulent, overblown
person, Jacquaine would not view it as
a temporary fascination. Her soul was not
adapted to the analysis of triviality. She ran
away from him. Husband-like, he was too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
proud or pig-headed&mdash;I won't venture to
decide which&mdash;to chase her. Meanwhile,
with the perversity of woman, she pined for
him, and haunted every concert room to hear
the voice of his art. By degrees the very
intensity of her soul's longing seemed to creep
into his hands and sob its despair through
his fingers. His technical skill came forth
through a halo, as though crowned with the
fire of her thought which surrounded and
encompassed it. Of course, the world saw
but the amplification of his artistic faculty,
and his fortune was made. Then a beautiful
charmer metaphorically wiped away his tears,
for he had yearned for his wife in the
enigmatical fashion of weak creatures who
prefer to morally gamble and deplore their
losses rather than save. Jacquaine became
poor as well as sorrowful; she pined for her
husband's love, but whenever she would have
craved it, other women courted him. Her
talent waned as his expanded. At this
juncture Broton, the millionaire, who had
always admired her, gave a big supper to
Bohemia, leaving her husband out. The
entertainment was mightily enjoyable, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
Broton's wine was sound and his guests witty.
When the fun was fast and furious I happened
to cross a drawing-room in search of brandy
and seltzer. Not a soul was there, but on the
verandah I spotted our host and Jacquaine.
The earnestness of his expression and pose
were a contrast to his usual stolidity and to
her apparently callous mood. He was offering
to her what showed like a bunch of violets
enfolded in a note. For the moment I fancied
she had given acceptance, but suddenly she
sprang from the chair, threw the bouquet and
paper on the floor, and ruthlessly ground her
heel into them. Then she stalked away&mdash;he
following and remonstrating."</p>

<p>"What happened?"</p>

<p>"Well, in my zest for flower history I leapt
forward to rescue this little bouquet and found
that which I imagined to be a note was in fact
a cheque for &pound;8000."</p>

<p>"Signed by him?"</p>

<p>"Yes; made payable to bearer."</p>

<p>"What did you do?"</p>

<p>"What I knew she would have desired. I
enclosed it in an envelope addressed to him
and left it before daybreak at his own house."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Without a word?"</p>

<p>"Without a word."</p>

<p>"And this is the bouquet?"</p>

<p>"Yes. It is the only souvenir I have of
one who was dear to me. Whether I loved
because I pitied or pitied because I loved
I cannot say. There are some riddles which
no one can solve."</p>

<p>"You never tried?"</p>

<p>"No. She was a noble woman, and her
husband, too, was a decent fellow, as far as
men go. They were admirably fitted by
nature for each other, but matrimony dislocated
them. That is another of the riddles
that frustrate us."</p>

<p>To avert further comment Bentham folded
the page and lounged deeper into his chair,
as though overcome by fatigue.</p>

<p>Presently he resumed.</p>

<p>"That is a pansy. It was pressed in a
book. It marked the place. We read the
poem together, she and I, that creature of
warm wax pulsating with childish naivetes
and provoking contrariety. We read it together
in the orange gardens of the hotel
looking out over a green transparency of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Mediterranean. I wonder if the scent of
orange blossom, warmed by the breath of the
sea, is an intoxicant, if it soaks in at the
pores and quickens the veins to madness?
Mine never seemed so palpitating with
delirium as in those days with her by my side,
and the free heavens and ocean for her setting.
Yet she was ready to leave me without
changing the indefinitude which always
accompanied her words and actions, to leave
me on the morrow&mdash;for I was anchored to
a studio and some commissions to which I
was pledged. But though she had a certain
prosaic flippancy of speech which spelt discouragement,
my heart refused a literal translation
of her idiom. On the last day I
determined to sound her, and subtly contrived
to wrest her attention with this poem. We
read it together. Her soft cheek neared mine
with a downy magnetism, and vagrant fibrils
of tawny hair danced with the wind against
my ear. After the second verse I placed this
pansy as a mile-stone to colour our travels on
the open page. She assisted me to flatten
the curling leaves, and my huge hand extinguished
her tiny one. Then I whispered&mdash;oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
never mind what I whispered&mdash;it was a
line of nature that the artistic reserve of the
poet had omitted. She closed the book and
covered her face with her hands to hide the
trouble and the tears which puckered it. I
made a nest for her in my arms, but she
fluttered free out into the orange orchards and
so to the house. All day I wandered about
sore and sulky. At night I tried to see her,
and was informed she was ill. On the morrow
I was startled to find she had gone with her
friends by the early train."</p>

<p>"And did you not hear from her?"</p>

<p>"Yes, she left a letter behind; I should
like to show it you&mdash;to see what you make
of it."</p>

<p>He rose and from his bureau extracted a
note; then he resumed his seat and tossed
me the almost illegible scrawl:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Lionel</span>,&mdash;All this time I have been too blessed&mdash;too
supremely happy to face the truth. You do not know
my real name nor my grievous history, and the more I love
and honour you the harder becomes the revelation. I can
endure it no more&mdash;so good-bye.</p></div>

<p>"And was that all?"</p>

<p>"Absolutely. I pressed the pansy in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
poem, and vowed&mdash;such vows are cheap&mdash;never
to trust a woman again. But, after all,
what claim have we to view our love as a
priceless gift when we invariably demand
cent. per cent. in kind? I have argued this
out with myself, and realise that I was her
debtor, I was first an artist whom she had
patronised and then&mdash;a man whom she
had&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I was going to say&mdash;ennobled. Don't
you think there are some women who, by
power of faith, transmute even clay-footed
idols into gold?"</p>

<p>I shook my head and prepared to turn over
the leaf, but he made as though to remove
the book.</p>

<p>"That last one is a marguerite. It tells a
very bald narrative&mdash;just a common instance
of man's blockheadedness and Fate's topsy-turvydom."</p>

<p>Bentham threw aside his cigarette and
closed his eyes. He was looking worn and
old.</p>

<p>"I think I have told you all," he continued
presently, "except about these petals. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
were gathered from the ground as her fingers
shredded them to discover whether I loved
her <i>passionement</i> or <i>pas du tout."</i></p>

<p>"The same person?"</p>

<p>"No, another; she was what is called a
coquette&mdash;an innocent girl baby, who played
with men's hearts as children probe sawdust
dolls&mdash;from a spirit of inquiry. For some
silly wager she flirted with a man staying in
the hotel, an uncouth provincial clown whom
I ignored. But it maddened me. I started
for the States to accept a commission that had
been offered&mdash;that my love for her had held
in the balance&mdash;and&mdash;and I never saw her
alive again."</p>

<p>There was a long pause, during which the
clock on the chimney ticked its forever&mdash;never&mdash;without
remorse. Gradually the
synopsis became more complete, for I could
trace the outlines of the buried hours in
Bentham's grey, impassive face. Then he
went on as though soliloquising:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now I return to it, England seems wider&mdash;its
population smaller. It is as if we lived
in a great silence like that in the rarified
atmosphere of Swiss heights. Yet the streets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
are in a turmoil. Beaming girls and bedizened
harridans flaunt in the Row, carriages
roll, and polite and impolite jostle each other
for gain or gaiety. There are great singers at
the Opera, great pictures on the Line, great
festivities everywhere. There is a <i>frou-frou</i>
of silken skirts, with the scent and the
laughter of happy women round and about
me, from dawn till nightfall. Yet my soul
shivers somewhere outside. Shivers"&mdash;he
repeated, shrinking into his coat as though
midsummer were March&mdash;"Why is it? I
have lived and loved and&mdash;as you know&mdash;recovered,
but now&mdash;oh, Louis, is there anything
so mutely desolate as fresh spade prints
on a grassless grave?"</p>

<h2>A Quaint Elopement</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Ah! little sweetheart, the romance<br />
Of life, with all its change and chance,<br />
Is but a sealed book to thee."<br />
</p></div>


<p>It took Ralph Hilyard over twelve hours to
journey from Southampton to St Malo on
that momentous June night. The sea tossed
and bounded and roared, but he kept his
footing on deck, well satisfied with Nature's
frenzied accompaniment to his own tempestuous
thoughts. He was being borne to
the historic town where She, from infancy to
womanhood, had dwelt; he would meet those
frank blue Breton eyes adjured for a year&mdash;eyes,
whose innocence in one less well
descended might have spelt ignorance&mdash;he
would adore the graceful form, that, while
clamouring of beauty, hinted all unconsciously
of the <i>haute noblesse</i>, the ghost of which
abides in St Malo to this moment, though the
substance has long since passed away. He
would risk all for the encounter, he told himself.
Round the subject his mind had revolved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
for three hundred and sixty-four days; on
the three hundred and sixty-fifth his thoughts
had sprung to action&mdash;he had set sail.</p>

<p>Her people, an austere mother&mdash;who loathed
the name of the Republic and rigidly clamped
her door against both the bourgeoisie and our
British nation of shopkeepers&mdash;and her
brother, Le Sieur de Quesne, a foolish and
thoroughly useless fine gentleman, occupied
"La Chaumais," their ancestral domain, near
St Servan, on the river Rance. This domain
was almost as hermetically sealed as a convent,
and far more gloomy. It served to perfection
as a prison for the peccant Leonie, when it
was discovered that, during a fortnight's stay
with an aunt in Paris, she had ventured to eye
as a lover a portionless upstart, an artist who
worked for mere bread in the Quartier Latin.
Here, for twelve months, the poor delinquent
was incarcerated. In this mouldy mansion
she either knitted or stared vacantly out at
the rank unkempt grass and the dilapidated
fences, kept by poverty unrepaired, while her
parent reiterated stories of the grand old days
when the tapestried chairs, woefully faded,
had been fresh and beauteous, and when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
de Quesne nobles had flitted from the
splendours of the Tuilleries to hold rural court
within those blackened portals now so severe
of aspect, so melancholy and silent with the
pulselessness of stagnation.</p>

<p>A sore punishment this for having confessed
in her heart's <i>naivete</i> a passion for a hero of
the brush, a vagrant in velveteen who painted
pictures and&mdash;vulgarian!&mdash;sold them to any
patronising passer-by. It was penalty dire
enough for a <i>debutante</i> who had but sipped
Paris, it waxed doubly dreadful to inquiring
Eve within scent of the apple tree. There
were tears at first, sobs of despair, then dumb
contumacy, and latterly&mdash;when the spring
weather returned again&mdash;kicks! But the
pricks of family pride were sharp to lunge
against, and many drops of heart's blood were
spilt in the exercise. Restrictions only grew
more rigid, and the poor little damsel, who
had tricoteed sombrely in the ancestral
dungeon during the winter, was, in summer,
never permitted to roam without the vigilant
companionship of the substantial retainer
Valentine, a worthy who, from her elaborately
starched <i>coiffe</i> to the heels of her <i>sabots</i>, was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
strongly imbued with a sense of conscientious
vassalage to "Madame," as Leonie's mother
in these degenerate days condescended to be
styled.</p>

<p>But love, which laughs at iron bars, makes
also mock at the effrontery of blue blood.
There came a day, not long after Ralph
Hilyard's sudden arrival at St Malo, when,
Valentine's expansive back being for a moment
turned, a two-lined scribble on a shred of
drawing paper was placed in Mademoiselle de
Quesne's hands.</p>

<p>It said curtly, with concise eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I want you. I can live without you no
longer."</p>

<p>The opportunity presented itself in this
wise. Though cut off from all other pleasures
of youth, Leonie was, at midsummer, for the
short six weeks' season, allowed to bathe in
the sea, attended by the faithful Valentine.
She crossed daily to St Malo on the "<i>Pont
Roulant</i>"&mdash;a quaint structure that, moved by
chains and steam, plies the water on sand-embedded
rails&mdash;and there joined in the
acquatic gambols of the merry crowd. With
the strange inconsistency of the narrow, her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
relatives, who had almost tabooed society, permitted
her to indulge her taste for swimming,
a sport in which she excelled. This laxity
probably owed its origin to routine cultivated
in the girl's childhood, and retained&mdash;as were
all the observances of Madame's distinguished
household&mdash;still intact and unchallenged.</p>

<p>At St Malo, as the tide ebbed, all the
delightfully <i>insouciant</i> and cheery French
world congregated. The sands near the giant
rock that marks the ideal resting-place of
Chateaubriand were dotted with tents&mdash;a
perfect army of mushrooms&mdash;which served as
disrobing shelters for the bathers. From
these emerged a brilliant throng of masqueraders
of both sexes, who tripped to the tide
with varying degrees of elegant assurance.
As Leonie's lithe figure, with its natty tunic
and cherry waist-band, slipped from the tent
(Valentine for the moment was arranging the
shed raiment) a gamin with bare limbs and
furled shrimping net lurched up against her.
There was unusual audacity in the eye of the
youngster, but the disrespect was forgiven
when a missive, crunched in his plump palm,
was transferred to hers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>She clasped her hands, drew a long breath of
rapturous surprise, and devoutly whispered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Que Dieu soit beni!</i>"</p>

<p>The Catholic and Breton temperament is
so finely interwoven that even this sudden
overstepping of family restrictions had to her
its pious side. She could there and then, in
effervescent thankfulness, have knelt to worship
all the infinitesimal saintlings of whom
her lover had never heard, but who, with her,
were active pioneers to mercy. Besides this,
love, which, when real, touches the religious
string in every breast, had so long played an
accompaniment to prayer and worship, that
her first action was almost mechanically
devotional. Her second, in contrast, was
crudely mundane. Valentine, complacency
beaming from her triple chins, loomed expansively
in the doorway of the tent, so Leonie,
slipping the billet in her mouth, sped for
protection to the ocean, the only haven where
she could be free from company and espionage.</p>

<p>She battled against the waves till she neared
the protective raft in deep water where
timorous bathers never ventured. Then she
hoisted herself up, took the scrap of paper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
from its hiding place, and re-read it, crossing
herself devoutly and crying with childish
exultation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh sea, beloved sea, you have brought
him to me at last! Never, never shall he
depart but with Leonie!"</p>

<p>As she declaimed, a man's head appeared
above the arch of the waves, and on the
instant they recognised each other.</p>

<p>He sprang to the raft and deposited himself,
radiant and dripping, by her side. They
were too far at sea to be minutely observed.
The roisterers on the beach could do no
more than discern a couple of resting forms,
a common sight in the bathing season.</p>

<p>"I arrived a week ago, and have been
dodging you ever since," he explained.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon cheri</i>," she only said. Love's babyhood
learns speech with difficulty.</p>

<p>"I have searched here in the morning when
the soldiers parade&mdash;I have loafed up and
down the St Servan Street till I know all the
good people's wardrobes that hang to air&mdash;I
have sneaked about the forts, and been nearly
'run in' for a spy. I almost despaired of
seeing you, but now, at last, we are together."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>His tone was dramatic with genuine ecstasy.
Since their parting life's fruit for him seemed
to have been pared and segmented with a steel
knife&mdash;at this moment he felt as one who
stands free to eat in a luscious raining
orchard.</p>

<p>Leonie answered him never a word. She
was speechless with stupefied satisfaction.
She only laughed, looked down at her dainty
sand shoes as she bobbed them in and out of
the sparkling water, then, with a caressing
glance at his drenched head, laughed again.</p>

<p>The English language sounded beautiful
indeed, but her happiness found no sufficiently
comprehensive outlet in that scarcely familiar
tongue.</p>

<p>"Little one," he said, earnestly, "do you
love me enough to be mine, to take me for
now and always?"</p>

<p>She nodded only, but her beautiful blue
eyes, borrowing intensity from the azure sky,
seemed to answer and envelop him with an
embrace of adoration.</p>

<p>"You must obey me; you must trust me
much, very much," he explained, seriously,
seeing the gaiety of her mood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>"To obey&mdash;to trust? Of course! Is not
all enclosed in love? Have I not said, 'I
love you?'"</p>

<p>"Enough to leave everyone, to come&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"How? Valentine?" she cried, with a
sudden look of terror; "she waits&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"To-day," he admitted, "but to-morrow?
You will be here in the same place?" He
leapt up and knelt imploringly on the dancing
planks.</p>

<p>"Yes," she whispered.</p>

<p>"And from that hour you will give yourself
to me?" he insisted.</p>

<p>"To you I gave myself a year ago,"
she said, with solemnity, her candid Breton
eyes beaming like a bluer heaven upon
him.</p>

<p>He moved uneasily.</p>

<p>"You will not regret?" he urged, in some
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Shall I regret that there is a God? that
when we love He speaks with us?"</p>

<p>He pressed her hands and kissed them.
Her faith was vastly simple, yet vastly
complete.</p>

<p>That night he wandered about the restricted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
area of St Malo long after the Curfew&mdash;La
Noyette, as it is termed&mdash;had sounded and
the private dwellings were closed. He was
distraught with misgivings. Was he a latent
blackguard? he asked himself, or had he yet
the courage to withdraw, to leave this
innocent girl buried in her dungeon, inconsolable
and doubting his fidelity?</p>

<p>No, he had not the courage. Fate held out
its magnet&mdash;he must go whither it should lead.
He was not an apostle&mdash;merely a man, an
atom in the fortuitous system to be swept
where destiny should decide. Need he, an
artist, be more chivalrous&mdash;he put it baldly&mdash;more
conventional and self-abnegating than
other men? Must he, when the delicious
moment of love's ripening had arrived, forbear
to pluck, to eat? As he had loved this Breton
girl a year ago he loved her, despite their
severance, to-day. Nay, more, for in this year
had he not flung himself headlong into the
orgies of his Bohemian life to strangle recollection,
and had he not been haunted by
memory's unresting ghost, the more exquisite,
the more endearing for its intangible, ineffaceable
outlines? He recalled some verses of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
homage to the city he had encountered in an
old St Malo record:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Quiconque t'a connue aime ton souvenir<br />
Et vers toi, tot ou tard, desire revenir."<br />
</p></div>

<p>He had come back to the "Souvenir" and
realised how the character of this <i>Ville d'elite</i>
so "<i>douce et pieuse</i>," so grandly sombre, so
exquisitely poetic and noble, was expressed
and summed up in her, his queenly, gracious
Leonie. He decided finally that, come what
might, she should be won!</p>

<p>The next day he was seated on the raft full
half an hour before she appeared. In the lap
of the waves he espied a purple-suited nymph,
enwound with a sash of Roman red, extending
white arms that glistened like newly chiselled
marble in the green spray. Her pretty
lips laughed as she swam towards him,
the sole atom in an immensity of chrysoprase.</p>

<p>That day the usual crowd on the shore was
thinned; a market and fair of some kind at
St Servan had lured visitors and St Malouians
to the other side of the Pont Roulant. The
beach was comparatively deserted, and even
the boatman who was deputed to row about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
the bathing course for purposes of rescue, was,
with his craft, apparently off duty.</p>

<p>"How well you swim," said her lover,
admiringly, as he greeted the young girl and
noted enviously the drippings from her disfiguring
cap that were privileged to alight
upon her dimpled cheeks. He was tempted
to put an arm round the pretty panting figure,
but resisted.</p>

<p>"It is my one <i>passe temps</i>. I have swam
half to Cezambre and back," she exclaimed
proudly, indicating, by a glance over her
shoulder, an island that reared its rocks some
two miles distant.</p>

<p>He flushed slightly.</p>

<p>"It is there that I want you to swim&mdash;now,
when you have rested."</p>

<p>"Too far," she sighed; "we could never get
back."</p>

<p>"We should never come back," he announced
with determination.</p>

<p>"Valentine? She will think I drown."</p>

<p>"She would prefer to bury you at La
Chaumais?"</p>

<p>Leonie laughed.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" he said, arresting further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
objections and crushing a word of endearment
that rose to his lips. To be successful he must
be matter-of-fact. Everything now depended
on promptness and a cool head. He pulled a
knotted string and lifted from the water a
cork belt.</p>

<p>"You must run no risk of fatigue," he said,
fitting it to her fragile form. "Now, let us
start. Valentine will soon be on the <i>qui
vive</i>."</p>

<p>Without demur she accepted his hand and
leapt with him from the far side of the raft.</p>

<p>The sea stretched a sheet of silver under a
sky of gauzy opal, shot with flame from the
dozing sun; wind and tide were in their
favour. Before long they had passed from the
sight of the shore to the shade of the giant
rock, whose railed summit, dedicated to
Chateaubriand, seems to commune with and
command the elements. Cezambre in the distance
was as yet merely an apparent triangle of
spikes jutting from mid ocean, but towards it
they plied their way valiantly, two moving
human dots, on the breast of the vast abyss.
Once she laughed uproariously to relieve her
happiness, but he checked her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p>"We must reserve our forces, my darling,
every breath in us. Valentine will give the
alarm directly. She will wait and wait, and
then there will be a hue and cry. It will
be a matter of life and death. Do you
understand?"</p>

<p>In the earnestness of his face she read for
the first time all that this adventurous swim
would mean for them both.</p>

<p>"If they come," she panted, "you will not
leave me, you will not give me back to
them?"</p>

<p>His jaws clenched hard.</p>

<p>"Never!" he vowed. "We will go under
first!"</p>

<p>He trod the water for a moment while he
scanned the expanse behind them. "Go on,"
he begged of her; "I will catch you up: spare
yourself as much as you can."</p>

<p>His precaution was needless; nothing was
to be seen on the still surface of the sea, and,
as the rock now screened the shore, it was
impossible to guess what might be taking
place there. Presently he gained on her.</p>

<p>"Safe so far," he said. "Don't speak; float
a little."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<p>He caught the side of the life-belt she wore
and swam out, drawing her in the direction of
the island. Some sailing boats fluttered across
the horizon, but their route lay in an opposite
direction to that of the swimmers, who had
now left the rocks and were well in the open.
Gradually the St Malo coast grew more indistinct,
and by degrees in front of them the spikes
that had represented Cezambre developed into
rocks. Then Leonie assembled her flagging
forces and struck out with renewed zest. The
sun was going down, and a cool breeze came
up behind them and seemed to give them
impetus and freshened courage. Before
twilight they had safely piloted themselves
to shore.</p>

<p>As they rose from the depths he flung his
arms round her with a sense of ecstatic relief.</p>

<p>"Now, dearest, we must brave it out; go to
the coastguard's hut, and"&mdash;he pointed to an
oilskin satchel which he had worn across his
shoulders&mdash;"buy him."</p>

<p>Leonie cast on her lover a glance of awe
and pride and worship. He seemed to be
God and fairy tale miraculously combined.
She believed herself to be treading Elysium<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
as they took their way to the humble stone
cabin occupied by the coastguard and his
son, the only inhabitants of the island. Her
young brain reeled with the intoxication of
freedom. How much rosier than any she had
before seen were the sea-pinks that flowered
their way; how surprisingly azure the common
bluebells that nodded and waved and seemed,
as they passed, to be ringing chimes to
celebrate her happiness. And even the
potatoes that grew in the little garden plot
where this coastguard Crusoe toiled, had
they not a world of wonder in their blossoms,
in their golden eyes, which watched and
watched and glowed, as she believed, before
the triumphant coming of their Love?</p>

<p>A rude hobbledehoy of the St Malo peasant
class opened the hut door and stared. Then
he said something in his opaque <i>patois</i> which
only Leonie could elucidate. She had often
imitated the vulgar of her race from sheer
<i>plaisanterie</i>.</p>

<p>She replied in the same key, and, seeing
that the youth comprehended, the artist
prompted a duologue.</p>

<p>"He says," Leonie began by explaining,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
"the coastguard is ill, he cannot leave him
to go ashore, and does not know what to do.
He refuses to take us back in his boat."</p>

<p>"He is under the delusion we want to go
back? Good! Give him money and say
we will stop here and attend his sick man."</p>

<p>This explanation ensured their entry. The
boy was evidently relieved of a burden. The
hut was composed merely of two rooms, in
one of which a weather-beaten old man was
evidently bedridden from pain. He looked
askance at the two bathers, but at the same
time his son put a coin into the sufferer's
hand. The youth, with the acumen of
his kind, understood the relative value of
eloquence and action.</p>

<p>"Clothes&mdash;food," Leonie translated at her
lover's request.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head. Then his eyes
fell on the rough suit belonging to his father
which was slung across the end of the bed.</p>

<p>"That might do for me," the artist
cogitated, with wrinkled brow, "but for
you?" He looked seriously at his sweetheart.
The boy's eyes followed his glance
and read it. The sick man turned in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
bed, groaned, and wondered when these
troublesome people were going away.</p>

<p>Leonie rubbed a gentle hand on the invalid's
shoulder; it was presumably the seat of the
worst pain. He suffered rheumatism in its
most acute form, so the coastguard explained
between his throes. He was afraid to seek
help from the land, lest his condition should
be known and he be removed from his post.
Their silence was implored with tears and
prayers&mdash;he would give them food and
shelter if they would keep his secret. They
promised assuringly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the lad had disappeared into the
inner room&mdash;it suggested a combined kitchen
and workshop&mdash;and came back dangling
from his arm some fragmentary portions
of his wardrobe, which he displayed with
pride.</p>

<p>"If madame would condescend?" he hinted.</p>

<p>At the word "madame" Leonie blushed
delightedly.</p>

<p>He led the way into the kitchen, and
deposited the dry clothes on a chair.</p>

<p>Ralph remained by the sick man, rubbing
the afflicted limb, and expressing himself in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
the vilest French he knew in hope to imitate
the local jargon.</p>

<p>He spoke sufficiently to crave bread and
drink, and to learn that these were only
obtained when fetched from the land in the
island boat. His son, the coastguard said, was
seldom allowed to go ashore, lest he should
commit himself and divulge the fact that illness
kept his sire from duty. Fortunately the
boat had been provisioned that morning, and
there was food for several days.</p>

<p>During the conversation the artist adjusted
the coastguard's overcoat and trousers, which
latter were three inches too short for his
lengthy British limbs.</p>

<p>Presently a transformed Leonie emerged
from the inner chamber. "An ideal fisher
boy," the painter thought, as his enraptured
eye travelled up and down the coarse blue
clothing. When it reached some loose locks
of her shining hair he became puzzled. She,
divining his thought, felt in the pocket of her
newly-acquired coat, and drew forth a maze of
gold, soft as fleece of raw silk fresh from the
cocoon, and gave it him.</p>

<p>He began to scold at the sacrifice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a web to entangle your love for
always," she murmured, with cooing lips,
which seemed, there and then, to suck the
heart out of him.</p>

<p>He would fain have swept the coastguard
and his son from the hut, but the exuberant
<i>patois</i> of "madame," the more exuberant by
reason of her characteristic disguise, broke
out, demanding of the lad refreshment, and
illustrating her request with significant pantomime.
The childish joy of this noble Breton
damsel as she devoured the rude meal in
company with their quaint hosts delighted
him, and the charming <i>abandon</i> with which
she threw herself into the comedy of the situation
brought heat to his already tingling blood.</p>

<p>Suddenly she grew grave.</p>

<p>"I was so hungry I forgot to ask a blessing,"
whereupon the buoyant little creature
uprose from her seat and offered a prayer.
The short Latin sentence was familiar to
Ralph's ear; it was common to the whole
Catholic Church; but now it had a parenthesis&mdash;a
parenthesis during which her loving
eyes looked first to his, then heavenward&mdash;a
parenthesis of praise and thanksgiving <i>for him</i>.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>

<p>He bent his head to hide the flush that
overspread his cheeks, and, for an instant, he
buried his face in his hands.</p>

<p>When the meal was over, Leonie ran into
the potato garden. She gathered some loose
weeds of which he did not know the name,
picking here and there carefully that all of
them should be of the right sort.</p>

<p>"I could not go to sleep and leave the old
man to his pains," she said. "Of these"&mdash;she
pointed to the herbs&mdash;"the poor people make
poultices when they suffer."</p>

<p>He took the bundles from her hands and
kissed her fingers. "You shall sleep, dearest,
and I will devote myself to the poor fellow.
We have reason to be very grateful to him."</p>

<p>"Very well, doctor," she laughed. "You
must be careful to stew the leaves very
soft."</p>

<p>Then she walked in and commanded the
boy to get grass in a bag for a pillow,
declaring merrily that some fishing nets and
canvas in the kitchen would make her a couch
fit for a queen.</p>

<p>The poultices certainly soothed, though
they did not cure, the sufferer. This fact<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
Ralph painfully discovered during the long
hours of the night. His limbs were weary, and
though the floor at the foot of the coastguard's
bed was hard, he yearned heartily for rest.
But the poor invalid, by whose side the son
snored obdurately, hourly implored relief.
Faithful to his word, the nurse, uprose at
intervals and put fresh leaves in the stewpan,
warming them on a rustic stove till soft
enough for use. This lasted till day dawn.
Then the lad went forth a-shrimping, and
Ralph decided to refresh himself with a plunge
in the sea. Washing utensils, he had discovered,
were unknown in Cezambre.</p>

<p>He was speeding down the garden in bathing
suit when he caught a glimpse of his purple
dolphin riding the waves.</p>

<p>"I squeezed myself out of the window so as
not to wake you," she spluttered, through the
surf. "I thought, <i>mon cheri</i>, you would
repose for ever."</p>

<p>"The old man is very thankful to you for
your prescription." He avoided the confession
of his night's unrest. "We must gather some
more of those herbs to-day."</p>

<p>"Perhaps, but not till evening. You don't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
know that we must hide. There may come
strangers for trips on boats from St Servan,
and one is never sure."</p>

<p>"Your people?"</p>

<p>"Oh no; they would do nothing so <i>roturier</i>&mdash;English
and Americans&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"They would not know us; you forget what
a good gamin my noble lady makes."</p>

<p>"I did forget," she chuckled. "I will dig
potatoes, and you may take the boy to the
other side of the island. The strangers only
go there to stare one moment at the rocks
and cry 'Oh!'"</p>

<p>When at midday the trippers landed at
Cezambre, they saw no one but an urchin
bent double over a spade. His face was
covered with mud, some of which was also
spattered on the floss silk of his hair.</p>

<p>A tourist addressed him, and received a reply
in broad <i>patois</i> which he could not understand.</p>

<p>The youth was very voluble, despite the
irresponsiveness of the audience; he waved
his hand indicating the beauties of the island
with an air of ownership. Now and then he
punctuated his speech by rubbing his fustian
arm across his nose in true plebeian fashion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
The tourists were delighted, and, before
departing, dropped a silver coin into his
grimy but exquisitely shaped palm.</p>

<p>When Ralph returned she met him, dancing
and rubbing the mud from her cheeks.</p>

<p>"See," she said, tossing the coin in the air,
"this is the first wedding present we have had.
I will cut Cezambre upon it and wear it for
ever. But first you will come with me."</p>

<p>She took his hand and led the way to a
curious cave carved in the rocks, in the centre
of which was a cross. The walls were frescoed
with common shells, the offerings, she explained,
of poor pilgrims who had been
worshippers at this primitive shrine.</p>

<p>With unconscious grace she prostrated
herself in prayer.</p>

<p>He watched her in silence, his artist eye
greedily tracing the picturesque in every line
of this innocent devotion, though his panting
heart longed to intrude on the sanctity of her
worship. Presently she lifted her hand to his
and drew him to his knees by her side.</p>

<p>Softly, like the sonorous gong from some
grand cathedral belfry, she commenced to
recite or chant in Latin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p>"Speak with me," she whispered, repeating
the melodious words with an accent of
reverential appreciation.</p>

<p>He did as she bade. The fervour of her
devotion communicated itself to him, he followed
word for word to the end. The
burthen, though not the absolute meaning
of the sentences, inspired him&mdash;it was the
ceremony of marriage they quoted, it was
God's blessing they mutually invoked.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When they had returned to the potato
garden, and were plucking herbs for the
poultices he had promised to renew during
his midnight vigils, he suddenly remarked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must leave here for the English coast
as soon as we can get a fishing smack to take
us along."</p>

<p>"Leave here?" she uttered in dismay. "I
would remain for ever."</p>

<p>He gave a short gasp, clutched her hands,
and looked straight into the transparent blue
depths of her eyes. Then he moved away a
step or two and shook his head.</p>

<p>"It is inevitable; we must go to England&mdash;give
ourselves over to law and parson."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here it is better," she cooed; "you are
king and I am priest." But he dissented.</p>

<p>"I never had much respect for Church or
State. I appreciate them as one appreciates
steel to sharpen one's blade against."</p>

<p>She did not understand. Only the simplest
English formed her vocabulary, but she saw
he disagreed with her.</p>

<p>"Here we are everything," she said; "we
make laws straight from God for ourselves."</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and sighed.
"Those, I find, are the toughest laws of all!
Come, darling, let us ask the boy yonder
about the fishing boats."</p>

<p>They were informed that one might possibly
pass on the following night. He borrowed
from the youth a piece of hard chalk that
acted in lieu of pencil, and begged Leonie to
write with it on some rough paper which had
served to wrap stores from the land.</p>

<p>"Tell your mother that we have decided,
after three days on this island, to leave for
Brighton, on the British coast, there to marry.
A year ago we asked her blessing on our love,
and she refused it; we pray that she will now
be more lenient."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"No good," murmured Leonie, translating,
however, what he had dictated.</p>

<p>Below, he scribbled the address of an hotel
in England, where a reply might meet them.</p>

<p>"She is sure," he said, folding the note, "to
call me a blackguard, and as certain, I hope, to
consent."</p>

<p>"My best and dearest," cried the girl in
prospective contradiction of anything that
might be pronounced against him.</p>

<p>Twenty-four hours later, when the fishing
smack alluded to hove in sight, the missive
was handed to the coastguard's son. He was
ordered to take it inland on the morrow, and
deliver it without fail, at "La Chaumais."</p>

<p>"But supposing my brother should not
write? Supposing he should come?"</p>

<p>"That is what I hope. Le Sieur will
support the dignity of the De Quesnes&mdash;he
will engage with the law and leave us to
engage with only love."</p>

<p>So the next evening they put out to sea
through the gossamer scarves of moving
twilight&mdash;the man in his coastguard kit gay
to frivolity, the girl in fisher disguise, meditative,
half tearful. She breathed not a word<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
while her straining eyes could clutch the outline
of the land from the embrace of night;
but when all was wrapped in gloom she lifted
her gaze to the star-spangled heavens, and
murmured with folded hands, "<i>Cher Royaume
de Cezambre, adieu!</i>"</p>

<h2>Trooper Jones of the Light Brigade.</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"To get myself in courage&mdash;crush out fears;<br />
To strive with fate for something more than gold."<br />
</p></div>


<p>A year or two ago I received an envelope
containing a lock of flame-red hair wrapped in
a soiled linen rag. By this token I knew
that old Sergeant Kemp&mdash;the name is a
pseudonym, for reasons which will be seen&mdash;Sergeant
Kemp, formerly of the Light
Brigade, was dead. This knowledge unseals
my lips, and permits me to divulge an
extraordinary episode of the charge of
Balaclava which was related to me by the
veteran, and which, as far as I can judge,
has entirely escaped the research of the
romanticist and historian.</p>

<p>My original intention in going to see the
old hero was to interview him and learn if he
could throw any new light on the tragic and
immemorial events of '54-5-6, through which,
with the exception of a slight wound in the
wrist, he had passed unscathed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>

<p>I propitiated him with gifts of tobacco, and,
having found the "open sesame" to the cave
of his reminiscences, visited him often. My
object was to filch, surreptitiously as it were,
the treasures I coveted, before their valuable
crudity could suffer the unconscious adulteration
to which such goods are liable at the hands
of the professional story-monger. But I found,
when the strings of his tongue were unloosed,
he had very little more to relate about the
events of the campaign than is already
recorded. In fact, like many an actor in the
drama of life, he really knew less about the
general <i>mise-en-scene</i> than I, who had only
reviewed it through the lorgnon of Tennyson
and other contemporary writers. Seeing,
however, that a shade of disappointment was
cast by the fogginess of his disclosures, the
old fellow one day abruptly asked if I could
keep a secret were he to tell it me. I vowed
my complete trustworthiness, but at the same
time remonstrated that confidences so
hampered would be of absolutely no use to the
work I had on hand. He rose laboriously
from his chair&mdash;lumbago had almost crippled
him&mdash;and produced from a tin box a soiled rag<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
containing the curl of red hair which is now in
my possession.</p>

<p>"This 'air," he explained in mumbling
tones, "was cut off the 'ead of Trooper
Jones of ours&mdash;in times of war one 'asn't
much truck with the barber," he parenthesised.
"We called 'im 'Carrots,' as bein'
most convenient and discriptive like. And
that there bit of shirt belonged to my pal
Jenkins, as good a chap as ever wore shako.
It's the 'istory of 'em both as I've 'alf a
mind to tell you, but you must be mum as
old bones about it&mdash;at all events till this 'ere
bloke's a-carried out feet foremost."</p>

<p>"And then?" I said, with unbecoming
eagerness.</p>

<p>"Then you can jest do what ye darn
please; the 'ole three of us 'll be orf dooty
together."</p>

<p>So he related to me in a fragmentary
manner, halting now and again and blowing
clouds from his pipe as if to assist his
ruminations, the strange history of Trooper
Jones, almost word for word as I have set
it down. He began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was in May that we got orders to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
embark.... I can remember turning
out at four in the mornin' to march to the
dockyard, and 'ow the green lanes was all
a-sproutin' and a-shinin', and 'ow the sky
was that pink and streaky, for all the world
like a prime rasher. But that's neither 'ere
nor there.... We 'ad been billeted
in the villages nigh Portsmouth for several
days, and my comrade, James Jenkins, and
I 'ad been quartered at an inn kept by
Jones' father and 'is sister&mdash;a strappin' girl,
and as like her brother as one bullet's like
another. They was twins, them two&mdash;with
top-knots the colour o' carrots, mouths as
wide as oyster-shells, allus grinnin', and a
power of freckles that made their faces as
yeller as speckled eggs. But Jenny Jones
was a stunner, she was; she served at the
bar, and gave the boys as good as they
gave&mdash;'ot sauce for the cheeky and a clout
o' the 'ead if need be when mi lady's blood
was up. Woman-like, she was that contrary,
wi' a tongue as sharp as a razor for some
o' us, and all butter and honey and eyes
like a sucking-calf whenever Jenkins so
much as showed 'is nose. And 'e, 'e was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
that sweet on 'er as though she'd been a
Wenus cast in sugar."</p>

<p>The old fellow blew a mighty whiff from his
pipe, a whiff that was akin to a sigh, and for a
few moments he became apparently fogged by
the retrospective haze that surrounded him.
He seemed disinclined to relate more, but as I
remained silent he presently resumed:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I won't tell you of all the 'arrowin' sights
of that there mornin', the women&mdash;mothers
and wives and sweethearts&mdash;a-snivellin' and
a-sobbin', the men lookin' all awry, as though
they'd swallered a chemist shop and couldn't
get the taste out o' their mouths. All this
wi' shoutin' of orders, and noise of the 'orses
bein' slung up the ship's side and let down the
main 'atchway into the 'old, and the playin' of
the band, and the cheerin' of the crowd in the
dockyard, and the crews in the 'arbour, and
the youngsters on the <i>Victory</i>&mdash;old fellers
they must be now&mdash;a-roarin' fit to split
'emselves from the yards and riggin' so long as
we 'ad ears to 'ear.</p>

<p>"I, bein' som'at of a bachelor by instink, 'ad
no gal to wish me God-speed; but Jenkins,
poor chap, was in the same boat. Jenny<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Jones 'ad not put 'erself about to see 'im nor
'er brother orf, and as they stood alongside
one another looking that solemn and glum, I
couldn't 'elp thinkin' o' the 'eartlessness of
wenches in general and that there in pertikilar.</p>

<p>"But soon I thought no more on the
subjec', for there was other things to mind.
There was dinner, and givin' out of sea kit
and gettin' our ration of grog&mdash;three parts
water it was to one o' rum then, but it grew
to 'alf a gill and a gill a day later on."</p>

<p>"About Jenkins?" I reminded, seeing that
his brain reeled with the reminiscence of bygone
potations.</p>

<p>"Oh, I didn't see 'im at that time. We
went below to the stable; our beasts was
stood wi' heels to the ship's sides and their
sorry 'eads a-facin' of each other. They was
awful bad, and mighty funky of the lurchin's
of the ship. I found Jones down there&mdash;'e
was a-bathin' of 'is 'orse's nose with water and
vinegar, and a-cheerin' of 'im up to eat, which
he wouldn't do for all the coaxin'. 'Carrots'
spent all 'is spare time at that there game,
givin' short answers and cursin' freely now
and agin. But 'e did 'is work right<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
enough&mdash;cleaned stalls, polished and burnished 'is
saddle and accoutrements like the best of us&mdash;though
whenever I looked at 'im there was
some'at shifty in his eye and an odd turn o'
the 'ead, as though 'e'd been a-sneakin' rum, or
a-doin' somethin' as was contrary to regilations.
And one day he turns on me savage like:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'What the &mdash;&mdash; are you lookin' at me for?
Can't you mind your own bloomin' business,'
sez 'e. So I ups and sez what came to me all
of a flash:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Yer no more Ben Jones than I be, and
what's more&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"Before I gets out another word 'e grips
'old of my hands and looks as though 'e was
a-goin' down on 'is bended knees afore me.</p>

<p>"'For Gord's sake, Bill, don't blow on me.
I've been a-dodgin' of you so careful, and you
was the only one I was a-feared on. I've allus
been civil to 'e, Bill&mdash;I'll give 'e my rations of
grog, Bill&mdash;I'll do anythin' for ye so long as
yer leaves me alone.'</p>

<p>"All this came a-rushin' from 'is mouth
like a water-shoot in summer that 'as been
froze for 'arf the year. Then I slaps my knee
and bursts into a roar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Good Gord, Jenny,' sez I, 'this 'ere is a
go! It's a desp'rate game you're a-playin' of.'</p>

<p>"'D'ye think,' she sez, 'I'd play it if I
weren't desp'rate, too? 'Ere was Jim and I
just married, and I not on the "strength"
and 'e a-goin' sails set for the grave. Oh! I
seed it, sure as I stands 'ere, and I sez to
mysel', wot's the fun of bein' twin with Ben
if can't go like 'im, an' fight shoulder to
shoulder with my Jim? Wot's the good of
this 'ere life without 'im, a-fillin' and a-swillin'
and nothin' more?&mdash;for that's all's left for
wummin when their 'earts is cut in two.'</p>

<p>"I put up my 'and, for there was someone
a-comin', and we went on a-cleanin' of the
stalls; but d'rectly I was able I stalked
Trooper Jones and got the rest o' the 'istory
out o' 'im. Course, I asks after Ben, our
real 'Carrots.' And she larfs with 'er mouth
a-gape and 'er white strong teeth a-shinin'.</p>

<p>"'Ben?' she sez, 'O, 'e was that sick 'e
couldn't say me nay; he was jist rolled up in
bed like a worm, and fit to stay there a week
or two. Nothing pisonous, mind you; but
all's fair in love or war, and this 'ere game is
both. So I got 'is kit and jist marched along<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
at daybreak wi' the lot of you. You should
'a' seed Jim's face when 'e recognises me.
He didn't guess whether 'e was glad nor
glum, so he cussed like a good 'un, and that
did dooty either way.'</p>

<p>"Young Jenny larfed till the tears came
a-rollin' down 'er uniform.</p>

<p>"'Yer brother's in for a nasty business,"
sez I.</p>

<p>"'Not a bit of it. I've settled it. 'E'll
dye 'is carrots and imigrate. Father'll see
to 'im; 'e never 'ad the constitootion as was
given to compensate me for being a&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Hold,' sez I, 'the timbers 'ave ears. I
am a-goin' to forget as there's any amphibus
animals 'ereabouts; there's only troopers and
'osses as I knows of.'</p>

<p>"'Gord bless you, Bill! None of the other
chaps 'ave twigged, and I've scarce throwed
a word at Jim since we got afloat. But I
looked at 'im and 'e at me, and folks with one
'eart between 'em don't need for words.'"</p>

<p>Here the narrator put a square thumb over
the brim of his pipe and pressed the weed
almost tenderly.</p>

<p>"In time," he went on, "I got quite proud<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
o' young Jones, 'e was as smart a dragoon as
any, an 'orsemaster every inch of 'im. Why,
the way 'ed whisper into the ear of them
beasts would make 'em meek were they
contrary ever so....</p>

<p>"It took us over fifty days a-journeyin' past
Malta and Constantinople and the Black Sea.
I was landed fust with one or two others to
report oursel's to Gen'ral the Earl of Lucan,
who was a-commandin' of the Cavalry Division.
Jones and Jenkins and the rest of our fellers
came over fully accoutred in 'orse-boats, each
at the 'ead of 'is charger. We soon 'ad work
enough, I can tell you, a tent pitchin' and
gettin' rations and makin' oursel's understood.
The town was choke full o' ruffians, Turks,
Jews, Armenians, Greeks, all a-jawing in
diff'rent tongues and a quarrellin' like magpies
over a bit of offal. 'Ere Jones was full o'
spirits, a-larfin' and a-swearin' with the best of
us. 'E 'ad a way about 'im as licked the
sourest grumbler into shape. And the gals,
such as they was, fancied 'is jovial mug and
made eyes at 'im. It was a rum sight to
watch the poor things a-wastin' ammunishun
on one of their own sex.  I mind me of a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
wivandeer of the Chasseurs D'Afrique, a
smart young lass in red trousers and a dark
tunic, with 'er plumed 'at all cockeye on 'er
head, and 'er legs astride the saddle&mdash;she was
quite took up with Jones. And afterwards
the Bulgarian gals was nuts on 'im, too.
Jones would give us real pantomimes a-snatchin'
o' kisses from one or another of
'em when they came to fill their wessels at
the well.</p>

<p>"'E was good at work or play was
'Carrots.'  Right well 'e came out of it
when we 'ad to turn our 'ands to odd jobs,
such as mowin' and reapin' and cookin', cos
'is fingers weren't thumbs like ours war.
And at skirmishin' and outpost drill, and
a-chargin' in line and by squadrons, he was
real smart too; 'e took to them man&#339;uvres
as a duck takes to water, with niver a growl
nor a grumble, 'owever 'ard the work.</p>

<p>"But a bad day it was for 'im when the
cholera broke up our camp at Devno; it
takes the strong 'uns fust, and then swoops
down promiscus-like. Poor Jenkins got bad
just as we was a-tired of buryin' an' 'earin'
nothin' but the 'Dead March,' which made<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the sick all of a tremble to know which would
be the next to be took. 'E was down with it
the wery day as we got orders to start for the
Crimea. We was to march the next mornin'
for Varna, and most of the night was spent in
packin' up.</p>

<p>"Jones, 'e comes to me like one stark mad,
beatin' of 'is breast and a-cursin' at the back o'
'is teeth.</p>

<p>"'Jim's that bad,' says 'e, 'they don' know
as whether there's any 'ope for 'im.'</p>

<p>"'They're preparin' of arabas to carry the
sick,' sez I, to console 'im.</p>

<p>"'Gord, Gord,' 'e sez, 'that's jest it. All
the sick as might get well will go, and the
others&mdash;they'll be left be'ind afore the breath's
out of 'em. I 'eard someone a-sayin' there
was no use in movin' of 'em as was as good
as dead.'</p>

<p>"And sure enough next mornin' I larnt
that Jones was right. Revelly sounded at
three, and by six every man was on parade.
Arabas, drawn by bufferloes, was packed wi'
sick, the dyin' was left in 'ospital with
orderleys and a sawbones to keep 'em company.
They must ha' 'eard us marchin',<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
marchin' away&mdash;them poor, animated corpses,
with jest the regilation number o' gasps between
'em and eternity&mdash;but most on us was
too busy to think on abstrac' things at sich
a time."</p>

<p>"How about Jenkins?" I asked, seeing
that my friend's mind had gone wool-gathering
over the whole panorama of the
war.</p>

<p>"Oh, 'e was safe enough; 'e took a turn for
the better at the last moment, and they
moved 'im into the arabas along with the rest,
but Jones looked 'iself badly enough. 'E
comes to me the nex' night and brings this
'ere lock of 'air in 'is 'and.</p>

<p>"'If I'm took,' sez 'e, 'give it to Jim and
tell 'im to wear it on 'is 'eart for the love of
"Carrots" as was.'</p>

<p>"I put the 'air in my 'aversack careless-like,
and gave 'im a drink o' rum neat, which
was better nor talk. It kippers the cholera
out o' one fine.</p>

<p>"'The likes of you and me is always
spared,' sez I, a-larfin'; 'rubbish ain't
marketable aloft.'</p>

<p>"And spared 'e was, and would 'ave been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
to this day, along with this 'ere lumber, but
for 'is cussed fool'ardiness....</p>

<p>"Things was lively for a bit afore and after
the victory o' the Alma, the pertikilars of
which I have reported to you. I scarce
clapped eyes on Jones or Jenkins, but they
was engaged in skirmishin' along with the
rest of us.</p>

<p>"On the day that Captain Nolan came
a-gallopin' in with that there momentous
paper, Jones sez to me, 'There's somethin' up,'
and we saw Lord Lucan and Lord Cardigan
a-lookin' at them guns. The enemy had
ranged 'em across the walley about a mile
and a-'arf orf, with a field batt'ry on the 'ill
on our left front, and another between the
redoubts and the walley on our right.
Captain Nolan was a-pointin', and the generals
was a-confabulatin'. Then we was told to
mount and move orf at a trot. The first thing
that 'appens was poor Captain Nolan a-gettin'
shot almost afore we broke into a gallop. 'E
was struck by a bit o' shell, and d'rectly after
the guns began a-playin' on us all, and the air
was 'eavy with groans and curses and screams
of men and 'orses a-fallin' to right and left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
like nine-pins. Jenkins and Jones was with
me on the right of the line, Jenkins as blue
as a corpse, and Jones flushed and savage-like,
avoidin' as best 'e could the 'orses without
riders as still kept pace with us, and the press
of men and beasts a-jostlin' to close to the
centre. We couldn't see where we was a-goin'
cos o' the power 'o smoke, nor 'ear 'cos o'
the boomin' and bustin' and bumpin' round
the 'ill-side. Then bang I goes. A shell 'ad
caught my poor 'orse in the shoulder, and over
'e rolls and I under 'im, fortunately covered
from the explodin' pieces as would 'ave settled
me 'ad they 'ave reached me. Jest as I was
beginnin' to wonder whether I was really
breathin', over my 'ead comes the second line
a-gallopin' for all they was worth. 'Twas a
near squeak that, and I was mighty 'mazed to
find that never a 'oof 'ad come nigh so much
as a finger o' me. At last I got clear of my
poor beast&mdash;'e was only a dead 'ulk, all 'is fore
quarters bein' blown away&mdash;and tried to
stand. It was precious difficult, an' as I was
limpin' in an 'op-and-go fashun, I chanced on
Jenkins who 'ad likewise been bowled over,
an' was lyin' under 'is 'orse in a pool o' blood.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Jones was a-kneelin' by 'is side with 'is left
arm clean ripped up. I suspects a splinter
from the same shell as caught Jenkins 'ad
struck 'im.</p>

<p>"''Elp me to draw 'im out,' sez 'Carrots,'
with never a quiver o' the eye.</p>

<p>"I lent a 'and, and Jones with 'is only arm
was a-strugglin' to move 'im, but we soon saw
we was only causin' of the poor chap unnecessary
aginy.</p>

<p>"'It's all up wi' me,' sez Jenkins in a failin'
voice. 'Clear out sharp, they're a-firm' from
the flank o' the batt'ry at them as is dismounted.'</p>

<p>"'Take care of Jenny,' sez 'e with 'is last
breath, and wrings my 'and.</p>

<p>"Then Jones begins a-kneelin' alongside of
'im a-callin' 'im by every sweet name as could
be thought on. Oh! it was a pitiful sight
to see a big dragoon a-huggin' of another,
a-kissin' of 'is lips and 'is 'ands, and 'im stone
dead, a-smilin' up at the sky.</p>

<p>"This 'ere 'appened in a minite like, for
d'rectly afterwards I sees Jones leap up and
catch a 'orse wot 'ad lost 'is rider and mount
'im. 'E just looks once at 'is poor comrade,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and out at the 'ills and the guns a-vomitin'
smoke. Then 'e starts off&mdash;not a-ridin' like
woman, nor man, nor 'ero, but a-gallopin'
like the wery Devil 'isself, straight into the
jaws of 'ell."</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which the old
trooper knocked out the ashes of his pipe
against the arm of his chair.</p>

<p>"That was the last wot I sees of 'Carrots,'"
he said, with a dry smile.</p>

Darlish</span>, <i>Secretary</i>; Mrs <span class="smcap">Egerton</span> and
Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>, <i>Visitors</i>; and the
"<span class="smcap">Celibates</span>," eight in number.</p>
</div>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scene I.</span>&mdash;<span class="smcap">The Club Room</span>.</h4>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span>. Oh, Mrs Egerton, you are just
in time. We are now to take the oath binding
ourselves to refuse all offers of marriage.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Egerton</span>. Perhaps I had better retire;
as wife, and mother of a family, I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span>. Certainly not; we welcome
any witness, and, after all, we owe much to
married women, since everyone of them is a
Curtius who, by a leap into the chasm of
publicity, may save a doomed multitude!</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Gracious!
I did not know I could leap anywhere. Pray
tell me how it is done.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span> (<i>glaring through her spectacles</i>).
The subject is too serious for trifling. Marriage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
is calculated to pen the free instincts of the
feminine community. You know our motto,
<i>Aut viam inveniam aut faciam</i>?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Egerton</span>. I see it all over the room,
but that doesn't tell me what it means.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span>. It means we will find a road
out of our bondage&mdash;or make one!</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>giggling</i>). Sail from
Scylla into Charybdis, eh? You see I allow
the tragedy of both destinations.</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span> (<i>sarcastically</i>). A kind concession,
but a frivolous. Still, we prefer the
risk of the unknown to the horror of the
known.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Graham</span> to Mrs <span class="smcap">Egerton</span> (<i>aside</i>).
What on earth does she mean? How many
times has she been married?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Egerton</span> (<i>aside</i>). Hush. You mustn't
offend the prejudices of the club. Ah, how
do you do, Miss Darlish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora Darlish</span> (<i>joining them</i>). Charming
rooms, aren't they? So glad to see you
here, Clare.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. Thank you, but I
feel rather like a fish out of water. It takes a
long time to cultivate amphibiousness&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Oh, we're not amphibious&mdash;we mean
to keep high and dry&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. I thought you didn't
forswear love and romance and all that kind
of thing, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Nor do we. We look on love as the
divine revelation of life&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. Oh! And then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. When love has ceased to be love,
we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. Scramble to the bank
to sun yourselves till ready for another dive?
I must tell Charlie&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Don't. You will put wrong constructions
on things. Of course we would
merely preserve the right to scramble out
in self-defence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>laughing</i>). I thought
so! How about amphibians? You ought to
re-christen the club!</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span> (<i>speaking above the buzz of
conversation</i>). Let us join hands and make
oath that, however pressed to marry, we will
refuse.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center">(<i>The</i> "<span class="smcap">Celibates</span>" <i>join hands</i>.)</p>

and whispering</i>). Dora, don't be a fool. You
know Charlie is devoted to you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Miss <span class="smcap">Hunch</span> (<i>severely</i>). Let me beg silence
while the oath is taken.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Chorus of the "Celibates"</span> (<i>with clasped
hands</i>). We solemnly swear that, however
pressed to marry, we will refuse.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>pulling</i> <span class="smcap">Dora</span> <i>to her
side</i>). Dora, I'm disgusted with you. Only
yesterday you gave my brother a book with
an inscription.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Well?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. I read it&mdash;there was
something about "Pure romance of love,
Idyllic and ideal as could be, All policy and
prudence far above."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. I'm not ashamed of it. Why
shouldn't our love be idyllic and ideal?
Why should wedlock of soul mean padlock
of individual?</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>angrily</i>). Why, indeed?
But don't talk against policy and
prudence. Your theory seems the quintessence
of both!</p>

the whole story surely you don't intend to
proceed with your absurd courtship?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. I mean to marry Dora, if that's
what you're driving at.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span>. It's impossible! However
much she wanted to accept she would
be bound&mdash;as a matter of honour&mdash;to refuse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>stroking his chin contemplatively</i>).
After all, marriage is merely a matter of
form, and if it pleases Dora&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>warmly</i>). To please
Dora you'll let Jane's boy inherit the estates?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. Still, Dora loves me, and she will
do anything I ask.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>rising irately to leave

with convictions are obstinate as Cork

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. I'm afraid I've disturbed the conversation;
I see Clare is ruffled.</p>

<p>Mrs <span class="smcap">Clare Graham</span> (<i>abruptly</i>). No, I was
going out. Good-bye. (<i>She goes out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. She is in a huff with me about
something. Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>hesitatingly</i>). No&mdash;that is&mdash;she
was angry with me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. About?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. Oh, because you and I agree with
each other so well on all subjects, marriage
included.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>pressing his hand</i>). My beloved!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. I said it was a rotten institution&mdash;or
something of the kind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>charmingly</i>). An effete conventionality&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>putting his arm round her waist</i>).
Only suited to reckless people who risk the
disappointments of the future for the
effervescence of the present.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. What did she say?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. She began to talk about my
sister's boy inheriting the property, as though
we cared.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Will he?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. Of course. It's entailed. But
he's a fine lad, and we, who will be all in all to
each other, need not grudge it him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>). I suppose not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. I believe that is the source of
Jane's affection for me. She knows how safe
I am in the matter of marriage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Then you have never contemplated
it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>emphatically</i>). Never!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>horrified</i>). And you made love to me
without any idea of proposing?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie.</span> You forget: you explained your
creed at the outset.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>paling</i>). Then you deliberately
availed yourself of the opportunity&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>drawing his moustache over the
corners of his lips</i>). Of adoring a girl whose
theories corresponded with my own? Yes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>with tears in her eyes</i>). Oh! You
mean you would not have loved me if your
courtship had involved marriage?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. I can't say. We both abhor to be
handicapped by legalities, don't we? We both
enjoy the same rights of independence&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>rising angrily</i>). Then, if loving me<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
had necessitated the surrender of your liberty
you could not have done it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>earnestly</i>). Could you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>sobbing</i>). Could I? I would have
loved you always.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span> (<i>taking her in his arms</i>). I would
have loved you in the same way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span>. Not if I had wanted to marry you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charlie</span>. I won't say. You never put me
to the test.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dora</span> (<i>excitedly</i>). But if I should? Oh,

<p>It had been a long engagement, commenced
by him between the ages of knickerbocker and
tobacco, and encouraged by her as a development
of the Prince Bountiful and Cinderella
romances of the schoolroom. A charming
contract, drawn up without sign and seal and
cemented after the manner of barbaric hordes
by heterogeneous offerings precious to the
engaging parties, such as guinea-pigs, bird's
eggs, looted apples, and, later on, prizes in
vellum, deposited with blushing triumph into
the concavity of a Dolly Varden pinafore.
Parents wagged their heads and forbade, but
the veto was conditional; the wisdom of the
serpent was allied to a certain downiness of the
dove, for hints at expectations in the future of
the impecunious suitor necessitated an attitude
both Janus-faced and revolving. Their
perspicacity was duly rewarded, for later<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
on the vacuous pockets of the young
subaltern&mdash;he had gone to thicken the "thin
red line"&mdash;became plethoric with inherited
revenues of a deceased uncle on the mother's
side, a personage for whom malt had been the
Brahma of idolatry, who had laid up for himself
a tidy treasure despite the corruptions of
rust and moth.</p>

<p>No sooner were the legacy dues arranged
than Victor Dorrien, in a letter beautifully
ebullient if ungrammatical, demanded permission
to import his chosen one to share a
temporary exile in India where, for the nonce,
he was tied by technical obligations. He
vowed that celibacy was dull, and soldiering
monotonous; and, moreover, that, without the
sweetheart of his youth to tease and plague
him, there would no glint on the avuncular
guineas.</p>

<p>The letter was a hearty one, and went the
round of the family circle to a chorus of satisfied
praise. The chorus did it. Someone has
said that "perpetual representation amounts
to inculcation," and this phrase ably describes
the uses of chorus. Continued reiteration
makes gospel truth. The family chorus on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
the subject of matrimony is the mainstay of
parental soloists, its note brings the recalcitrant
or frisking lamb to "mark time," and subsequently
dictates the pace of a quick march
to the impending sacrifice. Social excitement
is almost as sustaining as fanatical enthusiasm;
it is the intoxicant which inflames half the
actors that strut through the world's dramas
of marriage, murder, or martyrdom. It
sustained and inflamed little Elsie, who,
dizzy with congratulations, valedictory gushings,
present receiving, dress trying, and
orange-blossom choosing, ignored the importance
of life's destination in the enjoyment
of the surrounding and immediate scenery.
There was great leave-taking and kerchief-waving
and some coursing of tears down
kindred cheeks and noses as the bride-elect
was deposited, with wedding-cake, dress,
and addenda, on board the s.s. <i>Kenilworth</i>,
in temporary charge of a <i>pass&eacute;e</i> matron
of skittish proclivities and Anglo-Indian
epidermis. This obliging lady had volunteered
to personify decorum until arrival in
Bombay, when her youthful charge would be
transferred to the chaperonage of Dorrien's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
sister, on whom the observances of marriage
etiquette depended. Elsie was in no way
averse from the arrangement. All was so
novel and so exciting that the Columbus
instinct outbalanced the romantic one. The
world had much to offer and the suburbs very
little. There was certainly a well-grown
curate, an Oxford man, ingrained with
pedantry and pomposity, and delicately
veneered with artistic ethics; also a retired
bookmaker's son, who wore loud ties and
restricted "unmentionables," and who spent
money lavishly nursing a constituency, no one
knew where. On the other hand stood Victor
as she remembered him, sound in wind and
limb, handsome, honest, and professedly
devoted. Her choice was unhesitating, and
she started forth with dancing heart.</p>

<p>As usual came the inevitable <i>dies non</i>, when
the unfledged traveller makes a first bow to
the Channel, followed by one or two squeamish
days, when the Bay of Biscay as lauded in
poesy and the Bay of Biscay as discovered in
practice are two quite antagonistic things.
After which, with rarified complexion, the
sufferer forgets his troubles, and mounts the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
deck to enjoy a beatific spell of brine and
breeze.</p>

<p>So in due course did Elsie. She found Mrs
Willis, who was an old campaigner, busily
engaged in conversation, or its equivalent,
the note-comparing, gossip-scavengering tattle
which is inherent to feminine camp followers
of a certain age. Her companions were one
Major Lane and his friend, Captain Burton
Aylmer, the latter a person of some celebrity
in military circles where sport was supreme.
He looked lazy, long, and languid, and to
those who had seen him neither tent-pegging
nor polo playing, who knew nothing of the
spearing of veteran boars, whose tushes
fringed his mantel at home, nor of the
"man eater" duel, which in hunting annals
had made his name historical, he seemed
effete, if not affected. He was lolling at
full length in a rattan chair, listening indolently
to the flippant duologue of the
major and the grass widow. The lady did
not interest him. Her type was too cheap.
She represented one of an order that seemed
to be chromo-lithographed in reams for the
benefit of garrisons in Great Britain, India,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
and the Colonies; but when he discovered
in her the chaperone of a young <i>ingenue</i>,
with fringeless forehead and skin like new
milk dashed with sunset, his nonchalance
subsided, and he became almost polite. Mrs
Willis was prompt to detect the change of
tactics, and swift to solve the problem. She
plumed herself not a little on the possession
of a decoy duck, capable of luring so desirable
a prey as Captain Burton Aylmer into her
social toils.</p>

<p>"Be civil to him, my dear," she advised
when in private. "Half the women on board
would give their eyes to get him in tow.
He is very <i>difficile</i>." Mrs Willis affected
the slangy in talking to young girls. She
thought it gave a contemporaneous flavour
to the intercourse.</p>

<p>"He seemed to me pleasant enough,"
breathed Elsie, who was quite unscienced in
complexities of character.</p>

<p>"He can be when he chooses. They say
Lady Staines would have given her back hair
for him and followed him barefoot across Asia&mdash;but
he didn't see it!"</p>

<p>"Oh!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p>"He is very accustomed to that sort of
thing. His heart is quite tear-toughened, a
kind of spongiopiline&mdash;receptive and impermeable
at the same time."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you do him an injustice; there
may never have been a question of his heart?"</p>

<p>"His sponsor so soon? Beware, little girl;
they say he never loved since a certain queen
of society threw him over for strawberry
leaves."</p>

<p>"Threw him over!" A line of Tennyson
regarding the value of coronets flashed across
her. She wondered with a girlish contemplative
scepticism how this bronzed
physique, this heroic modelling, this almost
womanly gentleness of expression had failed,
having won, to hold.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Hour after hour passed in the usual shipboard
routine, by which every day became the
exact counterpart of its forerunner. Only to
Elsie was each moment a joy and a revelation.
It was impossible to disregard the fact that,
from being a juvenile of no account, she had
developed into a personage&mdash;a personage,
whose humble servitor society had been ready<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
enough to serve. In the conquest there was
no elation such as might have existed for
maturer women. She was too absorbed with
the all ruling presence to heed what happened
around. The wind was only fresh when it
carried his voice to her ear, the waves only
buoyant when they danced beneath their
mutual pacings; day was light, because she
shared it with him; night was dark, because
they were apart.</p>

<p>At last Mrs Willis betrayed signs of alarm.
"A mild flirtation is all very well, but people
will talk; you must really be careful, Elsie!
What will Victor Dorrien say when he comes
to claim his bride?"</p>

<p>Dorrien! His bride! The words mentally
thrust Bradshaw into the binding of Keats;
she suffocated as though she had steamed
direct from Eden to seaside lodgings. Was
she indeed affianced to this almost unremembered
lover of her childhood, and was she
indeed journeying straight into his arms?
How came it that the purpose of her voyage
had been almost forgotten, that the seconds
had grown so full of actuality as to outsize
the horizon, the zenithed sunshine so blinding,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
that all surroundings seemed enveloped in
atmospheric haze?</p>

<p>Each morning in her cabin she registered a
vow that the coming day should be the last of
illusion, that the stern facts of destiny should
be faced; each night her fevered, impatient
brain cried for dawn, to prove by the sight of
the noble outlines, the sound of the beloved
voice, that the end was not yet come. It was
scarcely his utterances that attracted; perhaps
the knowledge of his soul grew best from
what he failed to say, what he failed to seem.
But she saw the weary boredom of his eyes
change to fire as her glance sought his, and
she knew her lightest speech sped like spores
upon the wind to find a root and resting
place within his heart. She yearned to hint
at her projected fate&mdash;she yearned, yet
dreaded. Dissection of the sentimental mosaic
of years is no facile undertaking, so many
scraps and fragments go to the gradual
making of the romantic whole, and she dared
not approach the culminating tangle of the
love story without explaining in detail the
nascence and growth of the dilemma.</p>

<p>Thus with the course of the vessel drifted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the craft of emotion, past Suez, through the
broil of the Red Sea, out again into a
sapphire ocean.</p>

<p>Mrs Willis, looking ahead, saw breakers
and imminent wreck.</p>

<p>"You are both mad," she thundered at
Elsie. "This must cease; you must tell him
that in a few days, immediately on your
arrival in Bombay in fact, you are to marry."</p>

<p>"I cannot."</p>

<p>"But, child, think of it. What can you
do? You <i>must</i> go to Dorrien's sister's house&mdash;it
is all arranged&mdash;you will be married the
next day. You know I do not land, and that
there will be no one but the Dorriens to take
care of you. You could not even return
to England without delay that would be
scandalous."</p>

<p>All this poured in a breath from the
agitated chaperone, who had awakened too
late to a sense of her responsibilities.</p>

<p>"I will tell him to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
night ... it will be the last," sobbed
Elsie to the pillows in her restricted berth.
And when dinner was ended, the final meal
on board&mdash;for the vessel was steaming extra<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
knots per hour in order to reach port at
daybreak&mdash;these lovers met for their farewell.
They paced the dimly-lighted deck in silence,
with weighted feet, and hearts that scarcely
pulsed lest the bumper of anguish might run
over. Then, behind the wheel, where the
gusts of laughter from the expectant and
happy travellers could not reach them, they
halted&mdash;still silent, staring with parched,
despairing eyes at the swirling water and the
long track of dimpled silver that spread like
the trail of an ocean comet in their wake.
The night showed serene and purple, a universe
in regal repose, only the ship, throbbing with
insensate activity, rushed panting to doom; on,
on, on, while precious moments flashed fast&mdash;a
shower of jewels falling into the abyss, never
to be retrieved. There was no Joshua to hold
time in a spell; nothing to stay the deepening
hours from waning into a disastrous dawn.</p>

<p>She spoke. His profile cut dark against
the ocean reflections; there was no fear of
meeting his eyes.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning we shall touch
Bombay. I am going there to be married,
Captain Aylmer." Silence again. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
ship's machinery rotated evenly&mdash;mercilessly.
His face was sunk in shadow, she could but
guess that her speech was heard.</p>

<p>"Is it not news to you?"</p>

<p>Her words, like drunken footsteps on stony
soil, reeled despite an affectation of steadiness.</p>

<p>"No; I was told you would marry
unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Unless what?" she quavered.</p>

<p>"Unless you changed your mind&mdash;refused."</p>

<p>"Mr Dorrien's sister is my only friend in
Bombay. If I refuse&mdash;leave her house&mdash;I
shall be alone. I shall be helpless when
Mrs Willis and you are gone."</p>

<p>A light hand, hot and feverish, shot its
flame through his thin coat sleeve. He
shivered.</p>

<p>"That is what I am coming to. Stand
away from me&mdash;do not look at me&mdash;I want
to say something which sticks very hard."</p>

<p>He shrank back into deeper shadow.
There was horrible stillness. She stood
transfixed, chilling, as Lot's wife must have
stood when crystal after crystal replaced the
warm and buoyant rivulets of being.</p>

<p>"Elsie&mdash;I may call you that just once&mdash;you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
must not refuse. If you do, you will be
without any friendship but mine&mdash;and my
friendship would be worse than deadliest
enmity. The reason you must have guessed.
It has kept me tongue-tied till now&mdash;a coward,
a blackguard, some might say. The reason is
because"&mdash;his voice blurred hoarsely through
a strangled sob&mdash;"because I am married
already."</p>

<p>A convulsive gasp from her&mdash;scarcely
audible&mdash;no word.</p>

<p>He clutched at a rail and resumed almost
grimly, cauterising his gaping wound with
reality's searing iron,</p>

<p>"My wife is in a sanatorium, mentally
deranged. A virtuous woman, but she was
wedded to mysticism and morphia, and loved
me never a bit."</p>

<p>The fall of pitiful tears, tears from the
sweet blue of her guileless eyes, came hissing
against the red-hot cicatrice. His strength
almost failed. Such innocence, such loneliness
needed protection. But his! This man
who had brought down wild beasts in the
open, found deadlier tussle in the confines of
his brain. He quavered&mdash;his firm jaws<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
clenched. Reason is muscular, but nature is
subtle and crafty. With a jerk, a twist,
reason is overthrown, but it takes time and
heart's blood to stretch nature prone and
panting.</p>

<p>When he next spoke his voice was hard&mdash;uneven.</p>

<p>"Elsie, for God's sake help me! Don't cry,
or I must open my arms and hold you in them
for ever, come what may. We have needed
no words to translate love's language in&mdash;no
signs to show we were each to each the
complement that Heaven has made and laws
of men have marred; we shall need no oath
to bind us to remembrance. Good-bye.
Some day, when you are older, you may know
what it costs a fellow to protect a woman
from her greatest enemy&mdash;himself."</p>

<p>The sound smote her heart, harsh and grating,
like rusty steel. She could not scan the
ashen mask that hid the rage of conflict;
merciful darkness had enveloped the death
struggle with a gossamer pall. There was not
even a clasp of hands to tell his going; she
knew it, but still stood there, as the vessel
glided on into the sweltering night's maturity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
over a placid sea, under a placid sky, while
human passions raged and rent themselves in
useless agony.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two hours later all was silent; most of the
passengers, overcome with the tropical temperature
and restlessness, were sinking into
the fevered sleep that comes only when
night's noon has turned a cool shoulder to the
scorchings of the day. On the open deck,
to catch what breeze there might be, the men
slumbered, with forms inartistically outspread;
the women, in a more sheltered nook, though
not far removed, were stretched on couches all
in a row like shrouded corpses awaiting the
resurrection. Night looked down as on some
pillaged city where only the dead are left to
keep each other ghostly company. Suddenly,
from among them there uprose a small, white
wraith&mdash;lithe, barefooted, with wandering
hair. It fled, looking nor right nor left&mdash;its
footfall light as snowflakes&mdash;straight on, to
where the ship's track threw a ruffled tongue
across the stillness of the water. In a single
flash the silver ripples gaped, parted, closed
again, enfolding in the bosom of the deep the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
fair frail atom&mdash;an atom that seemed, in the
immensity, scarce larger than the feather from
a seagull's wing. Then the serene face of the
ocean smiled smoothly as ever, hugging its
hidden secret till the bursting of the grand
chorus when the sea gives up its dead.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And Burton Aylmer, afar off, with outstretched,
grey-flanneled limbs, lay motionless,
his hands clasped beneath his head, his eyes
staring with haggard scepticism at the floating
ultramarine of the heavens. His lips moved
as though framing a prayer, but he was only
muttering to himself, parrot-wise, the burden
of the ritual that bound him to "a virtuous
woman, wedded to mysticism and morphia,"
who loved him "never a bit."</p>

<h2>Some Crazy Patchwork.</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"Oh, love's but a dance,<br />
Where time plays the fiddle."<br />
</p></div>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>She was constitutionally a matchmaker, and
though recognising the infirmity was not
without its advantages, I refused to be made
an accessory after the fact. I declined to lend
myself to the introduction of my best
masculine friend, Lorraine, to my best feminine
one, Clair Conway. There was no petty
jealousy at bottom of the dissent, for sixty
winters had rolled over this philosophic head;
it was merely that I shirked the responsibility
of meddling with Fate.</p>

<p>But my sister, Sarah Sargent, had no such
qualms. "Matchmaker!" she exclaimed.
"Perhaps so&mdash;a woman without romance is
like an exotic without scent; and what woman
could know a lovely girl, and a man who is
intellectually gifted and eligible to boot,
without planning to introduce them?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>About Clair Conway's beauty there
admitted little dispute, though it was complex
to apprehend. Every feature was in drawing,
but nowhere arrogantly classical. A faint
scumbling, which poets might have described
as the mists of youth's Aurora, endowed the
face with a soothing indefinitude. In effect,
it acted like dew on summer turf which drapes
the emerald crispness in silver sheen. The
only obvious irregularity was a contumacious
tooth which peeped impertinently over the
centre of the lower lip, dimpling its fulness
with a tiny shadow. In that dimple lurked
the most fascinating lisp that was ever
modelled&mdash;a lisp not sufficiently full-bodied
to disturb the accent, but strong minded
enough to put stress upon it. Her figure
was in the bud. It had small natural curves,
which hinted at feminality, but it was fitted
far too well; the tailor had forced a masculine
exactness which was foreign to the subject
and to the statuesque creasings of her neck.</p>

<p>To me from her youth she had always
been a centre of interest. She was like some
half-studied volume of <i>belles lettres</i>&mdash;full of
temptations, subtleties, prose melodies, poetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
realisms. Her speech was fragile, and her
words, subdued by their passage through
the dimple, lagged now and then. Her
expression was seldom either animated or
pensive; never did green and yellow melancholy
chase the vermeil from her cheek,
seldom did excitement heighten it. She was
as serene as innocence and as clean-eyed, the
very woman I would have worshipped had
youth quickened in my veins.</p>

<p>"I knew Philip would admire her," my
sister related, when describing the kettledrum
she had given in furtherance of her
scheme, "so I introduced them at once!"</p>

<p>"Lorraine's fancies are protean, my good
Sarah. They are the result of appreciative
faculty. Someone&mdash;I think Emerson&mdash;says
that 'love is a mutual perception of the
same truth,' or something to that effect.
Unfortunately, as the artist soul is always
in pursuit of new truths, the deduction is
perilous."</p>

<p>"But," argued she, "Clair is the white
light of truth itself. One might go about
studying nuances, contrasting tones, and yet
value that truth eternally. I expected Mr<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
Lorraine would appreciate her for this reason.
He is a colour theorist, and with his knowledge
of values he can gauge the true beauty
of white light."</p>

<p>"Well, and the result?" I questioned, with
interest; for I myself had seen him spy out
Clair from among crowds of women, watched
his eyes lean on her, on the picturesque brim
of her hat and the curling feathers which
insinuated themselves against the contour of
her transparent ear, but had afterwards
escaped to avoid participation in Sarah's
plot.</p>

<p>"They seemed designed for each other,"
my sister pursued, "and I introduced them,
quite informally, of course. All the girls
had appropriate cavaliers, and I started some
music to give a spurt to the conversation."</p>

<p>"Music is certainly an excellent dam for
discoursive shallows," I muttered in soliloquy.</p>

<p>"Whether the introduction pleased her or
not," she continued, heedless of my remark,
"I could scarcely observe. She is an equable
enigma."</p>

<p>"A puzzle that is a wonder rather than a
challenge," I agreed. "And Lorraine?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"He, with his whole soul&mdash;and not a
driblet of it as usual&mdash;beaming in his eyes
faced her on the ottoman. The light from
the hanging lamp treated him kindly. It
threw some ripples on the silvery edge of
his hair, and shrouded the cynical depths of
his eyes in pensive shadow."</p>

<p>"If you were a younger woman, Sarah,
I should say you were in love with him
yourself."</p>

<p>"You may say what you please. He had
dropped his eye-glass&mdash;his solace in boredom,
as you know&mdash;and was listening, interestedly
listening, while she talked."</p>

<p>"Perhaps you exaggerated his interest?"</p>

<p>"No; there is a way of listening with the
eyes as well as with the ears. I could see his
fixed on the lisp dimple as it dipped. Then
the music began; I turned over the leaves,
and struggled to applaud, flatter, question,
but my brain was with them."</p>

<p>"Much better have left them alone," I
grunted.</p>

<p>"After all, they are your best friends&mdash;he
is your prince of poets, and she is your ideal
heroine."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>"One does not express friendship by laying
traps&mdash;but go on," I urged, curious in spite of
myself.</p>

<p>"Tea was distributed, and, either from
laziness or diplomacy, Philip never vacated
his perch. He sat intently watching her
while she dipped inquiring fingers into each
tier of the muffini&egrave;re, and piled a huge meal
on the Japanese plate at her elbow. She
seemed bent on advertising a Cassowary
digestion."</p>

<p>"An implied antithesis to poetic ideals,"
I volunteered, to enhance my sister's discomfiture.</p>

<p>"Perhaps so," owned Sarah, vexedly.
"Girls are very contrary. But," she continued,
"he perseveringly looked on with his
quaint air of critical inquiry while she spread
her handkerchief upon her lap, distending every
corner in ostentatious preparation for her feast."</p>

<p>"Talking to him meanwhile?"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>par parenthese</i>&mdash;between the nibbles
at a chocolate bouch&eacute;e, an anchovy muffin,
two biscuits, and a tartine."</p>

<p>"My good Sarah, it is scarcely hospitable
to register the appetites of your guests."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was really burning to hear them talk,
but Percy Vansittart buttonholed me to say
the muffini&egrave;re had run short of supplies. We
rang for a fresh consignment, then more music
was proposed. I induced Vaudin to sing
those exquisite verses of Philip's&mdash;about the
poet's tears, you know, which froze to pearls
on the neck of the woman he loved."</p>

<p>"Just the thing to annoy Lorraine!"</p>

<p>"He ought to have been highly flattered.
At the end of the song," Sarah pursued,
"people began to go, and I thought I would
take a seat in their direction without disturbing
the conversation."</p>

<p>"In fact you played the eavesdropper?"</p>

<p>"I merely wanted to catch some stray sentence
as guide to the situation. Had I felt <i>de
trop</i> I should have moved. I approached
cautiously and affected to be busy with plates
and dishes on a neighbouring table. Philip's
attitude was full of interest&mdash;he was intent on
some argument apparently.</p>

<p>"'I believe a pin is the orthodox weapon,' I
heard him saying with questioning eagerness;
to which Clair replied, 'Take my advice next
time and try a darning-needle.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"A darning-needle!  My curiosity was
aroused, and, as the subject seemed to admit
of invasion I adroitly wedged in.</p>

<p>"'A darning-needle? for what?'</p>

<p>"'Oh,' she exclaimed with <i>empressement</i>,
'we were talking of periwinkles&mdash;discussing
the efficacy of pins <i>versus</i> darning-needles&mdash;what
do you say?'"</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>After the routing of my sister Sarah,
I should have given up interest in her
proceedings had not a letter from Clair
reached me. It referred to a commission for
book illustrations that I had secured for her.
From this she volunteered her own patch of
information&mdash;a crudely-contrastive one, but not
without its value in the harmonious scheme.</p>

<p>"To-day," she wrote, "I was introduced
to your <i>rara avis</i>, Philip Lorraine. Lady
Sargent cannot praise him enough. Continued
praise of one individual to another is boring,
don't you think so? It is a moral throwing
of the gauntlet. Besides, I always suspect
the dear creature of designs. Something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
about her mode of introduction is Autolycus
like; one feels like a pedlar's pack with all
its little trinkets and tawdrinesses spread out
for the buyer. Ah, you don't know your
sister. To me she is a dear transparent soul
with her whole purport printed on the surface
like a sandwich board. She thinks the
woman world is ranged in three tiers&mdash;the
top story for eighteen-year-olds. Everything
there must be out on approval. It's no good
ticketing yourself 'Not for sale,' nor even
pricing yourself at a prohibitive figure&mdash;no
good whatever. She brings round her
customers, provides them with her own
lorgnon in the form of opinion, and pads them
with conversational treatises on the subject in
hand, like a Cook's guide to a party of
tourists.</p>

<p>"'She has more refinement than that,' I can
hear you say.</p>

<p>"Refinement, yes. Flowers do not grow
with their roots uppermost, but we know they
have roots all the same. Her social smile is a
very guileless plant, but I detect how far its
ramifications extend.</p>

<p>"Her second shelf is scarcely better, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
for the mothers, mild brooding creatures whose
brains perform kaleidoscopic revolutions with
the same <i>materia</i>&mdash;dinner <i>menus</i>, infant food,
servants' industries, and wardrobe renovations.
'The idea,' she would say, 'of a woman
earning her share of the family income,
contributing three hundred or so to the
housekeeping instead of saving! It is unconventional,
and, consequently, bad form.'</p>

<p>"And the last shelf is for the matrons,
dowagers, chaperones&mdash;middlewomen of the
matrimonial market like her dear misguided
self&mdash;social seals of respectability stamped
with the impress of a Buckingham Palace
curtsy; godmothers for the distribution of
hall-marked silver and hall-marked morality,
dragons&mdash;&mdash;. But I forget your friend, the
poet. Of course he thought I was 'trotted
out;' of course I hated him for thinking it.
I pretended never to have heard of him or
read his works. Literature was practically
barred, for I confessed I loathed poets. He
agreed, quoted Coventry Patmore, who says
a poet is one degree removed from a saint&mdash;or
Balaam's ass. Well, men saints are chilly,
and donkeys are troublesome, and kick. I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
told him so. Yet I abhor compromises! I
can't say what I do care for; certainly not
being thrown at men's heads like stale eggs
at election time!</p>

<p>"And what do you think we talked of?</p>

<p>"Not the modern girl, you may be sure.
Mr Lorraine is romantic, and thinks that
intelligent women are bound to be ill-shod,
splay-waisted, and brusque. I had half a mind
to undeceive him, but he might have imagined
I was accentuating my points. We talked of
all sorts of things&mdash;neutral things. I believe
we should have liked each other had I been
some nice young married woman with a red
star for 'Sold' dabbed on my frame. We
always admire pictures that are so ticketed,
don't we?&mdash;from sheer perversity, I suppose.</p>

<p>"I ate a huge tea. Byron hated women
with healthy appetites; I daresay Mr
Lorraine does the same. He watched the
muffins and the cakes disappear with an
almost zoological interest. I was on the
verge of inquiring if he ever visited the
lions at feeding time&mdash;but a song interposed.</p>

<p>"During this I intuitively felt his eye
exploring, 'totting me up,' so to speak.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>"Vaudin, the tenor, was singing exquisitely.
The words were from Mr Lorraine's last book&mdash;they
were beautiful, and I knew every line,
but affected ignorance.</p>

<p>"'What is that tune?' I questioned with
vulgar simplicity.</p>

<p>"'The one the old cow died of,' he answered.</p>

<p>"'But the words aren't bad?'</p>

<p>"'Think so?' he drawled, putting up his
eyeglass and surveying the singer, as though
the voice came from a marionette.</p>

<p>"I proceeded with some chocolate cakes,
too nervous for the moment to meet his
eye. He did not observe it, however, but
resumed his interest in the departure of
the edibles. It seemed absorbing! I wonder
if he will write a poem on <i>gourmandes!</i>
What fun to illustrate it and surprise him!
He does not know that I illustrate&mdash;what
a horrible discovery! To find in this piece
of plastic putty a nineteenth century working
woman!</p>

<p>"If he had not been a poet and a <i>parti</i> he
might have been very charming! As Lady
Sargent's dear friend, of course he shares her
opinions about the shelves, and my mind was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
bent on dispelling that old-worldism, on
stamping, 'Not for sale' into my speech
somehow. But there was little opportunity,
I saw he had mentally pronounced me such
a silly little girl.</p>

<p>"'Did I play tennis?'&mdash;'Loved it.'</p>

<p>(Truthfully, it has no attractions for me.
It was a recreation once, now it is a
profession, and one cannot adopt two
professions, but I didn't tell him that.)</p>

<p>"'Did I dance?'&mdash;'No.'</p>

<p>(I was forced into this admission. Balls I
forswear&mdash;the shelf is bad enough, but to
literally earn a husband by the "sweat of one's
face" is humiliating.)</p>

<p>"'No, I never danced,' was my answer. 'I
had no superfluous energy to work off.'</p>

<p>"Then we skimmed more trivialities.</p>

<p>"'Had he seen the new roller shaving
apparatus?'</p>

<p>"'Did I approve Ladies' Tea Associations?'</p>

<p>"'Did he prefer German to French food,
and was he a connoisseur of birds'-nest soup
or frizzled frogs?'</p>

<p>"'Scarcely, but in his youth he had tackled
periwinkles. That was valiant?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Not at all. I was his match. I had
eaten forty-two at a sitting!'</p>

<p>"'All self-picked with a pin?' he queried.</p>

<p>"'No,' I confessed, triumphantly, 'with a
surer weapon still.'</p>

<p>"'I believe a pin is the orthodox weapon,'
he advanced.</p>

<p>"'Take my advice next time and try a
darning-needle.'</p>

<p>"Here Lady Sargent overheard us. You
should have seen her face of disgust! Poor
dear, how promptly her castle of Eros was
blown to smithereens!"</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>Two days later we were talking of the
divine afflatus, and the relation of great work
to character, when Lorraine demanded my
opinion as to the analogy between thought
and conversation.</p>

<p>"Speech was given us to hide our
thoughts," I said, quoting Tallyrand without
in the least agreeing with him.</p>

<p>"I fancied you would say that," he replied,
and opened his note-book to refer to some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
jottings which had evidently been recently
made, and which supplied, strangely enough,
another impromptu and bizarre patch to the
unconventional whole so recklessly commenced
by my sister Sarah.</p>

<p>I append the jottings shown me by their
writer as a problem for unravelment. They
began:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Charming because she is perplexing, or
perplexing because she is charming? It is
impossible to say. At anyrate, the external
pencillings are pretty. Her manner at times
betrays pre-disposition to enmity, for the
flippant pose is merely a disguise. Is it
enmity, or is it reserve? One must take
into account the larger reticence of larger
natures in serious matters. A woman who
can be good reading to the clown must fail
to attract the scholar. Yet me she keeps
on the bare threshold of comprehension. Is
it because there is a barn at the back, or a
palace? Most people open up their drawing-rooms
at once, and parade their bric-a-brac.
Is she given to this want of hospitality in
speech, this loitering in the open air, or am
I alone treated as a burglar&mdash;an intruder,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
who longs to drag the arras from her sanctum
door?"</p>

<p>The next page rambled on in this fashion:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is an initial stage of some characters
which is purely parabolic, though every phase
of the stage has its analogy in the actual.
The difficulty is the tracing of corroborations.
With so much promise one looks for some
fulfilment, but she contrives to make out of
the very postponement of promise a larger
reiteration of it. She permits no shadow of
negation that might disappoint, no growth of
hope that might encourage. Her talk is so
well conventionalised to suit the tonic and
dominant of social exigence that one must
avoid the vulgarian error of striving after a
literal transcription of it."</p>

<p>A day later had been scrawled, with a dash
of irritation in the caligraphy, a third note:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Of dispositions like hers that are worthy
analysis, it is expedient to restrain the lesser
deduction in order to gain the full breadth
of the greater; one must look through the
eyelashes at the substantial flesh and blood
perfections to achieve the infinite spiritual
possibilities  deduced  by the instinctive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
calculus.... Spiritual possibilities! Am I
mad to seek for them in a woman-creature
with the appetite of a schoolboy and an avowed
<i>penchant</i> for periwinkles?"</p>

<p>"That last clause," Lorraine said as I came
to it, "is merely an ebullition of annoyance.
I mean to proceed with my analysis more cool-headedly.
The subject is interesting."</p>

<p>"Yes, proceed with it; but I won't warrant
the coolness."</p>

<p>"What do you bet?" smiled he thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"My dear fellow, I don't bet on certainties."</p>

<p>Just then the advent of visitors interrupted
the discussion, and a whole fortnight passed
without my seeing either the poet or my
sister.</p>

<p>I had begun to relegate the patchwork
romance to the store-cupboard of memory,
when into my room rushed Sarah with almost
juvenile impetuosity.</p>

<p>"Look at this! Did you ever hear anything
so crazed?" She threw a scrap of paper
on the table. It was addressed to Clair, and I
read it aloud:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Lady</span>,&mdash;You loathe poets. I therefore desire to
adopt another calling. Cab-driving might suit me, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>I fear I am lacking in the necessary command of language
to ensure success. I could sweep a crossing with neatness
and precision, and can pick periwinkles with unrivalled
velocity. To this end I have been practising daily with
a darning-needle and a stop-watch. Have you any
objection to entering the lists against me, the winner of
course claiming whatever guerdon he or she may desire?</p></div>

<p>The note was in Lorraine's handwriting,
and affixed to it was a copy of Clair's
answer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr Lorraine</span>,&mdash;Your poetic gifts will, I fear,
militate against advance as a crossing sweeper. The
occupation admits of no impressionism, and requires
uniform scrupulosity. With regard to the tournament, I
accept your challenge, provided, of course, there is a
competent umpire.</p></div>

<p>"What do you think of that?" questioned
my sister with concern.</p>

<p>"I think, my good Sarah, it is the oddest
piece of work you ever set your hand to, and
that you have let us both in for substantial
damages in the form of wedding presents."</p>

<h2>"The Soul of Me."</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"'The wrong was mine!' he cried. 'I left my dove'<br />
(He flung him down upon the clay),<br />
'And now I find her flown&mdash;ah, well away!'"<br />
</p></div>


<p>After long sauntering in the Antipodes, I was
naturally anxious to hear of him&mdash;of his inner
life particularly&mdash;for his fame as a worldling
had skirted the globe. The north wind had
trumpeted of it; the south had whispered
poetically, if insidiously; the east had contradicted
the poetry and accentuated the venom,
and western zephyrs had harmonised the whole
with a dulcet cadence of admiration and pity.
In his profession, however, public opinion was
unanimous in proclaiming him pre-eminent.
The signature of Wallace Wray&mdash;"Woll" we
called him&mdash;at the corner of a canvas lured
the artist mind to praise and thanksgiving; it
did more, it loosed some sluggish thousands
from speculative coffers&mdash;coffers that, prompt
enough to gape at safe investment, could stand
in the face of the divine afflatus, hermetically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
sealed. He had reached the peak on Parnassus
where criticism drops crippled and
diagnosis wrings its hands; his dexterity of
brush had become a species of sleight-of-hand,
backgrounded by the mysterious tissue of
philosophy, science, and emotion, which, commonly
called genius, defies ken or comparison.</p>

<p>He had been a singular youth, the solitary
output of one of Nature's quaintest moulds,
and from what I learnt, the singularity had
become pronounced rather than mellowed by
the glaze of time. Yet, as I remembered him&mdash;it
was five years since we had met&mdash;he was
an excellent fellow, a mass of incongruity,
courageous, sensitive&mdash;morbidly so&mdash;modest,
with a humility deduced from keen self-knowledge,
a generous companion and a witty,
dispensing the fine flavour of his humour
through a countenance as nearly classical as
individuality of expression would permit.</p>

<p>This countenance now showed its presentment
on the Academy walls. It was this
portrait, done by his own hand, which roused
my admiration and awoke a greed for more of
him. Around me, the wagging of gossip
tongues fanned the air, and scraps, hints,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
fragments of scandal were wafted to my ears
as I stood amazed to salute his art in the
superb masterpiece of portraiture.</p>

<p>From the confused babble I was straining
to sift a grain of truth. It seemed that
Wallace Wray had been outraging the feelings
of his admirers, had dealt them a slap in the
face as cleanly, or rather as dirtily, as a
realistic brush could deal it. In the nick of
time, Spry, a brother of the craft and the very
sieve I needed, jostled at my elbow.</p>

<p>"Splendid likeness&mdash;the best he has ever
done, eh? He calls it 'The Body of Me.'
Ha! ha! The Corporation of H&mdash;&mdash; commissioned,
it, and luckily he got it finished
before he took leave of his senses."</p>

<p>"Senses!" I echoed, stupidly. "What is
wrong? What has he been saying, doing?"</p>

<p>"More antics! Haven't you seen 'The
Soul of Me,' there, in the next room?"</p>

<p>And Spry, scarcely waiting for dissent, led
off, inviting me, by backward twists of the
head, to follow his pioneering.</p>

<p>The crowd was too great for conversation,
but it was easy to know from the congested
state of the room in a particular spot where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Wray's work must be hung. When patience
was nearly exhausted we reached it.
Comments and criticisms were freely bandied
aloud.</p>

<p>"Decidedly morbid," spake a sightseer in
disgust.</p>

<p>"Hideous! I wouldn't own such a picture
for worlds," confided one woman to another.</p>

<p>"It is astounding," an art critic remarked
to his companion, whose face I knew.
"What power, what genius, yet&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Genius is a loganstone," said the other,
shaking his head. "It rocks and rocks, but a
stalk of asphodel may shift it from its centre."</p>

<p>"For 'asphodel' translate 'woman,'" the
critic replied, "and you solve the riddle."</p>

<p>At this moment a gap opened; it was
sufficiently wide to reveal the subject without
the frame of the picture.</p>

<p>On a slab of wood in semi-darkness lay a
drowned woman. The rays from a lamp, held
aloft by a bargee or coal-heaver, flickered down
on the green-grey features that had already
lost the expression which accompanies the first
beatitude of death. Some outcast, as the worn
finery proved; young in years, we knew by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
modelling of her throat; aged in worldliness,
by the hard set of her features, the sparse
strands of faded hair that might once have
glittered. The folds of the frayed gown hung
lank, heavy with dark drops of liquid mud
which oozed and fell slowly to the ground,
already a morass of wharf drippings that
reflected pallidly the meagre gleams of the
uplifted lamp. The magnificent anatomy of
a beautiful arm, a shapely bosom&mdash;bared, it
seemed, in an effort to reanimate&mdash;showed that
this was no plebeian waif driven by stress of
poverty over the water's edge. On the elbow
was grim evidence of Wray's realistic mood&mdash;a
bruise, wide and purple, and higher up, the
dull indenture of a water-rat's tooth.</p>

<p>"Well," said Spry, watching my mute
amazement, "he has left no part of his
gruesome task undone; he has gloated in it&mdash;look!&mdash;even
to the snipping of the linen."</p>

<p>A definite jag on the front of the shift&mdash;the
place which is usually inscribed with the
name of the owner&mdash;was carefully insisted on.
It was the highest light in the picture, and
seemed to emphasise a piteous degradation and
still more piteous consciousness thereof.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>"Wray turned moralist?" a bystander
sneered.</p>

<p>"We may find sermons in stones, but we
don't want 'em on canvas," bounced another,
a "port-wine-flavoured" personage, who ogled
for applause with the confidence of the self-crowned
wag.</p>

<p>I eyed him with swelling spleen, and shot a
dart at Spry which was intended to ricochet.</p>

<p>"Wasn't it Flaubert who said that, in the
hands of an artist, a disembowelled ox would
make as fine a subject as any other?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," returned Spry, "but,
anyway, about this work there are ugly
tales afloat. It is too true&mdash;unpleasantly,
unnecessarily true."</p>

<p>It indeed appeared to be inhumanly horrible&mdash;a
vulture swoop of the brush&mdash;and, much as
I appreciated Wray as a friend and worshipped
him as a disciple, I was forced to recognise a
want of reserve, some lack of sentiment in the
handling&mdash;say, rather, over-handling&mdash;of so
repellant a subject. His aim seemed to lie in
choking sentiment&mdash;suffocating it in loathliness
and disgust. There was a violence of
passion that suggested the manner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
Prudhon&mdash;suggested it, but, giant-like, overshadowed
it with the brawny vigour of modern actuality.</p>

<p>I turned from the picture to the crowd,
blinked dazedly to find myself again facing daylight
and colour, and stretched myself awake
as far as environing shoulders would allow.
Looking away from this squalid scene, I became
suddenly aware of an unusual amount of
paint and gilding on the walls&mdash;an art tawdriness
that had not before obtruded itself. My
taste for the reproduction of veined marble
and glossy parquet, for pretty pussies and
portraits of gentlefolk was exhausted. I made
for the turnstiles, and nodded to Spry to get
quit of him.</p>

<p>"I'm off," I said, curtly, "to look up Wray
and offer my congratulations."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Green Park, bedecked in spring raiment,
seemed to me at that moment a welcome
oasis of verdure in the midst of the swirl of
Piccadilly; it offered no impediment to the
bubbling flood of conjecture that Wray's
strange <i>chef d'&#339;uvre</i> had let loose.</p>

<p>So far as I knew him&mdash;and our friendship,
though spasmodic by reason of my wanderings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
had existed since our teens&mdash;he was the last
man to sneak voluntarily into the shadowy
niches of life; his nature clung to radiance
and his sentiment revolted at the opacity of
pessimism. Why, then, this sudden hectic of
the sensational? Why, indeed, unless the
genius, the loganstone, as suggested by the
fellow in the exhibition, had rocked till it
tilted?</p>

<p>In the midst of my mental tussle, while
twisting the pros and cons in favour of
lunacy, and walking with bent head and
irresponsible stride, I fell foul of an obstacle.
It was Lawrence Vane, the poet, who, being
well known to me, chose this mode of salute.</p>

<p>"Your <i>moutons</i> are causing you trouble,"
he laughed. "Debts?&mdash;love affairs?"</p>

<p>"I have neither," I replied, without a
vestige of humour.</p>

<p>He was a breezy fellow, good tempered and
sound, but at the moment he was out of place.
Despite my abruptness he wheeled round and
kept pace with me.</p>

<p>"You were totting up your virtues then?"
he pursued.</p>

<p>"I can do that on my fingers. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
Wray's vagaries that puzzled me. I am on
my way to him."</p>

<p>His cheery mood vanished.</p>

<p>"Don't go near him," he burst out. "He
is a beast; I loathe him."</p>

<p>"He is my friend." (This with an accent
on the last word.)</p>

<p>"I expected that. They were my friends
once, but I never go there now."</p>

<p>"They?" I inquired. I had forgotten
the report of Wray's marriage, five years
before. It had taken place in Rome on
the eve of my departure from England.</p>

<p>"He and his wife. You met her? No?
She was the sweetest girl that ever stept."</p>

<p>"Was?" I exclaimed. "Is she dead?"</p>

<p>"Dead to us, to society, to happiness.
She left her husband within the year."</p>

<p>"Poor fellow!"</p>

<p>It was well to have met Lawrence before
going to Wray's studio&mdash;awkward situations
might have ensued. I delved for more of
the domestic history.</p>

<p>"She was the prey of mischief-makers&mdash;there
were so many who envied her. People
whispered cruelly of her mysterious elfish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
beauty, and women coveted her golden hair;
for nothing women resent so much as Nature's
own coronation of sovereignty. She was
only eighteen, and believed in him&mdash;worse
luck for her. Afterwards she became jealous
and tried the spur. It makes some beasts go
and some stand stock still. He gibbed.
Rash people&mdash;men&mdash;quoted Byron, told her
that constancy was woman's greatest vice;
others&mdash;women&mdash;bragged of the equality of
man and woman, hinted at levelling down
when you can't level up."</p>

<p>"He had cared for her?"</p>

<p>"It was a love match. But you can't plant
figs in the midst of thistles. He was easygoing,
hated a smart, so there was no
uprooting, and the fig tree perished!"</p>

<p>There were tears in Lawrence's eyes, but he
began whistling a music hall air in affectation
of nonchalance.</p>

<p>"Well," I said, extending a hand as we
neared Buckingham Gate, "it is miserably
sad, but thanks for instructing me. I shall be
saved unlucky allusions."</p>

<p>"You mean to see him?" he asked,
dejectedly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly."</p>

<p>With a wry sneer of dissatisfaction he bade
me good-bye, and I continued my way to the
studio.</p>

<p>Lawrence Vane's view struck me as narrow
and one-sided. He ignored the fact that Wray
was one of the most courted men in London,
that in England and America his genius drew
to him followers, patrons, friends of all ranks,
and that, as a natural consequence, there were
warm corners in women's hearts for this spoilt
child of fortune. With the world beckoning,
the fair sex flinging petals from the rose
gardens of love and admiration, he had needed
more than human dexterity to pick his way
through the scented labyrinths that were
continually twining around his feet.</p>

<p>I found him in, and he greeted me with his
rare smile. In an instant I observed that
he was no longer the same Wray, whose
presentiment he himself had painted for the
Corporation of H&mdash;&mdash;, no longer the harum-scarum
painter I had known five years ago;
it seemed as though he had thrown all the
buoyancy of colour and tissue&mdash;the veritable
body of him&mdash;on the canvas, and had left<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
merely a shadow of the original to walk the
earth.</p>

<p>The studio, a temporary one, was on the
ground floor. It looked out on the bustle and
swarm of the Buckingham Palace Road,
where the roar of traffic was accompanied by
wafts of martial music from the adjacent
parade ground. It made a bizarre accompaniment
to our reunion.</p>

<p>I strained his hand, shook it more than
once as an assurance. I wished to convey to
him that I was not ignorant, nor curious&mdash;in
fact, that I believed in him. My allegiance
was unshaken by Lawrence Vane's history.
I gave him the faith of friendship, which is a
closer grained quality than the faith of love.</p>

<p>We stood among his pictures and gossiped
of art, praising H's brush-work, wondering at
R's anatomy, arguing L's historical accuracy,
and talking of everything warily&mdash;on the brink,
as it were, of a plunge, like timid girls at a
river, dipping now a finger, a foot, an arm, in
the chilly depths, and wavering. When at
last we were seated he took a header.</p>

<p>"You've seen my portrait?"</p>

<p>"At the Academy? Just come from it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p>"You think I've flattered myself?" he said,
with his head on one side, his eyes asking
more than the question.</p>

<p>"It would not have done you justice three
years ago," I evaded.</p>

<p>"Good! I wished the husk to be a thing of
beauty. You think it a work that will live?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly, or the Corporation of H&mdash;&mdash;
would not have unbuttoned to it. It keeps its
heart well within the limits of its waistcoat."</p>

<p>"And the other&mdash;the kernel?"</p>

<p>I looked at him and arched an interrogative
eyebrow.</p>

<p>"The other picture? 'The Soul of Me?'"</p>

<p>"Of course I've seen it. It's magnificent
work, Woll, but I don't like it."</p>

<p>"Crude realism, eh?" he said, leaning sideways
and bending a palette knife backwards
and forwards on the back of his chair.</p>

<p>"More," I said&mdash;"exaggeration."</p>

<p>He paled. I thought it was in offence at
my critical presumption.</p>

<p>"There was none," he averred. "You
shall see the original sketch," and he paced to
an easel that stood, covered with a cloth, in a
distant corner. He unveiled it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ugh!" My cry was inevitable. I resisted
the impulse to shroud my eyes, but my teeth
clenched on words.</p>

<p>It was the same picture with a terrible
difference. Vivid, almost glaring, in the
black gloom and silence, the woman's form
represented a combination of all the debasement
and degradation of the world. Evil
spirits seemed to mock and writhe and
gibber in the sludge of the foreground; the
iridescent atmosphere hung with noisome
miasmic dews, even the face of the bargee
glowed like a fiend in the glare of his lamp,
held viciously aloft to reveal in its completeness
the whole squalid history of spiritual failure.</p>

<p>"Who was she?" I whispered at last&mdash;it
was a sight to shackle the tongue&mdash;and his
answer hissed back like the sound of searing
iron on sweating flesh:&mdash;</p>

<p>"It was my <i>wife</i>."</p>

<p>Heaven forgive me, I shrank from him.
The man who could thus portray accurately,
unmercifully, this tale of hideous defilement&mdash;the
victim his wife, however sinning&mdash;must
be himself either morally debased or partially
insane.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p>He saw the gesture, and moved away to
the foot of the model throne and waited.</p>

<p>I could think of nothing but the ghastly
achievement, could stand only with bulged
eyes staring at it, a dry, dusty flavour
parching my tongue. At last I broke from
the horrible fascination&mdash;a fascination that
almost prompted me to snatch his knife and
rip the canvas from end to end.</p>

<p>I flung down the cloth.</p>

<p>"Sit there," he almost commanded, and
pointed to an arm-chair at some distance from
him.</p>

<p>"You may shun me. It is what I wanted&mdash;deserved.
To that end I confessed it, 'The
Soul of Me.'"</p>

<p>Then on a sudden his meaning dawned.</p>

<p>"The body," he went on, "was painted
before I learnt what colour the soul was. I
will tell you."</p>

<p>"No, no!" I remonstrated, perceiving the
tension of his set jaws. "It will pain you,
and do no good."</p>

<p>"Pain?" he said. "There is no pain that
eats into the heart like silence. The knowledge
of guilt hidden corrodes like an acid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
It must have been that which taught the
Catholic Church the value of confession."</p>

<p>"Possibly," I said, moving from my
distant chair to his side, and grasping his
hand. "But remember I am not a priest;
I am only, and always, a friend."</p>

<p>"I know, I know," he said, hurriedly,
staring out across the room at the humming,
busy road. "My confession is not to you.
All that humanity can do the priests have
done. You stare? Yes, I've turned myself
inside out for them; but all their altar
flowers cannot scent a foul soul, nor can
their sanctuary lights illumine its crooked
corners. I'm no historian, but I've heard of
cases where private penance, remorse, and
religious absolution have totally failed to
wipe clean the hearts of intellectual men&mdash;they
of the world, sinners, needing absolution
of the world. Such men, who live in the
open, and trumpet their triumphs there,
need, too, to howl their confessions from
the housetop, carve their contrition, like the
wisdom of Asoka, on the immemorial rocks
as an outcry to the generations."</p>

<p>He started up, and began to stride about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
the room. His face was full of passionate
grief, and his wandering eyes passed beyond
me as though watching a sunset.</p>

<p>I thought of the loganstone, and of the
frail woman, the stalk of asphodel, who had
unhinged it. The great painter, sensitive
ever to colour and beauty and flattery and
happiness, to pin-pricks and to sneers, had
dropped in pieces before a real strain&mdash;sin for
which he held himself responsible, remorse
that found no outlet wide enough for his
great transcendent heart.</p>

<p>Presently he stood still before his picture,
threw back the curtain, and surveyed it with
folded arms.</p>

<p>"She was pure," he muttered, half to
himself; "sweet, sweet as new milk from
warm udders in cowslip time, and I&mdash;I
brought her to my cobwebbed life without so
much as a preliminary sweep of the broom.
She thought me like herself, and I dared
not undeceive her; but others&mdash;curse them!&mdash;they
taught her. She was pure as milk,
I said&mdash;ay, for milk absorbs poison quicker
than things less pure. She breathed the taint
from the loathly atmosphere of my world&mdash;of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
the world that had been mine.... But
I loved her ... would have won her
back&mdash;cringed to her. She spurned me,
spited me through herself, evaded me, till"&mdash;a
shuddering horror stifled his voice&mdash;"till,
by chance, I came on <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>I followed him to the easel, and placed an
affectionate arm on his shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, old man, you must clear out of this.
Come along with me back to the Bush, and
drop this nightmare."</p>

<p>"Drop it?" he flouted; "why, the world
reeks of it!"</p>

<p>"Not now. You say that even the priests
absolve you."</p>

<p>"Cheap contrition! cheap absolution! how
one cuddles them at first&mdash;at first! But in
time we feel our canker&mdash;it grows under the
clean Church wrappings&mdash;in time we learn
that where our sanctuary is, there, alone, can
our penance be. Hence this picture. It
accompanies the portrait, a gift to the nation.
You can't think what a going down on the
marrow bones it was&mdash;down on the stones for
every rascal to gaze and prod at, an attitude
for eternity."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span></p>

<p>"You'll come to Australia?" I repeated,
adhering obstinately to my matter-of-fact
bent.</p>

<p>"As you please. I feel clean enough for
your company now, for I have committed
suicide&mdash;not vulgarly, by murdering myself,
but suicide spiritually. I have given up the
ghost by working out the pitch through the
point of my brush, and the carcass is yours
to bury where or how you will."</p>

<h2>On the Eve of the Regatta.</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"'Why dost thou look so pale, my love?'<br />
'I hear the raven, not the dove,<br />
And for the marriage peal, a knell.'"<br />
</p></div>


<p>"A year to-morrow since our wedding day."</p>

<p>He lounged opposite to her in a Canadian
canoe, now talking, now soliloquising. Her
eyes were closed, the fine pallor of her face,
the steely lights of her dusky hair showed
contrastingly against cushions of amber silk
which propped her head. Grey was the background
and green&mdash;grey with falling gauzes
of twilight, green with luxuriance of leafage
in its emerald prime.</p>

<p>They had paddled to Shiplake at set of sun,
starting from their house-boat, moored in
Henley Reach, to return through the shady
backwater, which coiled like a slumberous
silver snake through the heart of a mossy
lane. Here they lingered under a languishing
tree&mdash;a very Narcissus pining over its own
image in the water, and shedding subtle
resinous odours of gum and sap upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
mellow air&mdash;determined to enjoy Nature in
mood of most infinite peace. Time passed
unheeded, and silence, the euphonious silence
of dual solitude, was only broken by the
casual twang of lute strings, or the sudden
enunciation of a half-modelled thought.</p>

<p>"A year to-morrow since our wedding
day." His voice thrilled with love and
tenderness, its tone caressed her ears, though
her eyes remained closed.</p>

<p>"You have been happy, dearest?" he said,
leaning forward and clasping one of her warm,
white hands.</p>

<p>"Very happy."</p>

<p>"And had all you anticipated?"</p>

<p>"All&mdash;more," she breathed, with opening
eyelids, "you have been very good, very
generous to me."</p>

<p>"Good? Can selfishness be mistaken for
goodness? You said you loved fine dresses,
it became my pleasure to choose you the finest
in the world&mdash;you longed for jewels, and
it was my pride to search for gems to match
your beauty."</p>

<p>"I was very greedy&mdash;too greedy. I care
less for such things now. Poverty makes one<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
worldly, selfish, mercenary; don't you think
so? I was so poor!&mdash;the very rustle of silk
was music to my ears, and the lustre of
precious stones seemed to conjure majesty and
beauty in a flash."</p>

<p>"And now you have nothing left to long
for?" He bent over her hand and kissed it,
and the little canoe, like a fairy cockle, began
suddenly to shake and dip in the swell of an
unusual tide.</p>

<p>"Nothing, dear," she answered him, while
her eye scanned the waves that had so
strangely ruffled their nook. "I wonder if
some launch is passing to swell the river so?"</p>

<p>"Scarcely; that bend in the creek would
save the wash from reaching us."</p>

<p>"But the water is agitated; look! it seems
as though a high wind were raking the face of
it." She gazed curiously up, and then down
the backwater.</p>

<p>The trees were swaying with a soft unheard
whisper of wind, and in the deepest shadow
companies of gnats were playing hide-and-seek
with each other. No sound but the hum of
insect life reached them.</p>

<p>"It is strange," she went on, stretching her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
hand to the quaking water and withdrawing
suddenly from the chill touch of it, "very
strange; it looks as though the sleeping river
had suddenly awoken."</p>

<p>"Dear little pottle of whims"&mdash;so he had
christened her&mdash;"what new romance will she
weave?"</p>

<p>"Oh, there is nothing romantic about that.
If it were grass, the 'uncut hair of graves,' it
would be different."</p>

<p>"Different! Is grass portentous? churchyard
grass especially?"</p>

<p>"Every green blade of the earth must be
'churchyard grass' as you call it. It all
springs up from life that was." She plucked
a tuft from the bank as she spoke, and laid its
moist blades in her lap.</p>

<p>"Then where's the omen?</p>

<p>"A silly one&mdash;an old Teutonic superstition.
They believe that if the second husband of a
woman treads the grave of the first, the grass
will wave till the corpse awakes from its
rest."</p>

<p>At this he chuckled joyously, her voice was
so appropriately tragic.</p>

<p>"But here we've no second husbands,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
and no tombs; only a fanciful little wife
who has burst the bonds of the matter of
fact."</p>

<p>"Was I so prosaic?" She stared at the
dancing gnats and flicked at them dreamily
with her glove. "Ah, perhaps so&mdash;in the
days when the pinch of penury forced one to
be tough and calculating. You could not
imagine, Harry, the fret of blue blood in
starved veins. To be poor makes one mean,
grasping, heartless; once rich, we can become
amiable, virtuous, heroic even."</p>

<p>"And poetic, eh?" he said, flushing at the
recollection of transformations that his love
and his wealth had wrought for Cinderella.
"Come, we must not forget the Lowthers'
dinner, we're due there now."</p>

<p>With this he paddled out from their retreat,
carefully&mdash;for the dusk was closing round
them&mdash;into the open river.</p>

<p>All along the banks a misty vapour, rising
from the earth, twisted and wreathed till it
wrapped the tow-path in gloom. Deep
shadows stretched their quaint deformities
fantastically across the wave, mingling deceitfully
with black clumps of tall reeds, into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
which the canoe occasionally glided with a
dangerous swish.</p>

<p>The distance from the backwater to the
Reach was fortunately short. Coloured lights
from the numerous house-boats that were
gathered in line to view the morrow's regatta
guided them, and from the merry laughter
which assailed their ears they learnt the
geographical position of Sir Eustace Lowther's
floating fairyland, styled ironically "The Raft."</p>

<p>"We're famishing," roared someone from its
balcony.</p>

<p>"So are we," came in duet from the canoe.</p>

<p>"Take care of the ice-box," called another
voice from the gloom, as a paddle hit some
obstacle in the darkness.</p>

<p>"Fiz cooling," explained a guest, appreciatingly.
"Your hand?"</p>

<p>Lady Rolleston gave it, and was escorted
up the steps to the feasting place.</p>

<p>It was set out with a studied view to polite
vagabondage. Deftly man&#339;uvred forks, two-pronged
twigs mounted in silver, and clasp
knives with chased and monogrammed
handles, garden lanterns in frames of fretted
iron, osier baskets bursting with an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
incongruous burden of river flowers and hot-house
fruits, champagne in old Bohemian mugs, ices
to be dug from crystal troughs with silver
trowels, all these heterodoxies accentuated the
bizarrerie which made "The Raft" such an
unique and enviable lounging place.</p>

<p>Among the guests were three painters, a
peer, a novelist, an actress of note, and one or
two women whose beauty was, if not classical,
at least effervescent and exhilarating. Merry
talk prevailed as a matter of course, and bets
were freely exchanged on the prospects of the
crews.</p>

<p>"I hope to-morrow won't be a pelting day
like last year; it was ghastly," said one of the
belles to Sir Henry Rolleston.</p>

<p>"I didn't find it ghastly," he chuckled;
"but then I wasn't at Henley. It was my
wedding day."</p>

<p>"Lucky is the bridegroom that the rain
rains on seems to be your version of the
proverb," chirruped his companion.</p>

<p>"We've been lucky enough, sun or no sun,"
he said, looking across at his wife, whose
lovely face wore a decidedly bored expression.</p>

<p>She was being worried by the peer, who,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
on the "if-you-want-a-thing-well-done-do-it-yourself"
principle, was vaunting his own
attitude towards the agricultural question.</p>

<p>"I never had such a wretched time," went
on the beauty, "we were moored higher up
last year, by the island, near where you are
now. But it wasn't all the rain, it was poor
Kelly's accident&mdash;you knew him, Basil Kelly?
Drowned, poor fellow, in the dark&mdash;canoe
washed ashore in the morning."</p>

<p>"Hush," exclaimed Sir Harry, looking
across the table and lowering his voice. "I
never knew the poor fellow, but my wife did;
they were boy and girl chums for years. He
was master at the Grammar School near her,
and a capital oar."</p>

<p>"That's what I couldn't make out. Did
you see what the papers said?"</p>

<p>"The papers were purposely kept from us.
It was too deplorable a subject to be mooted
on our wedding day."</p>

<p>"Did she ever know?"</p>

<p>"Yes, later, and bore it very well. She
was indignant at the suggestion of suicide,
but has never alluded to the subject since."</p>

<p>"Harry," called Lady Rolleston from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
opposite side, "Sir Eustace wants to know
why you moored so far up?"</p>

<p>"Oh," he replied, "partly because I was
a bit late and partly because we're best out
of the thick of it. I enjoy seeing the start
almost as much as the finish."</p>

<p>"We have the Club grounds to go to if
we like," explained Lady Rolleston, as they
mounted to the balcony where the thrumming
of guitars had already commenced.</p>

<p>All the racing visitors were gathered in
knots in the blue darkness; companies of
performers, niggers, German bands, and
banjoists were skimming along from house-boat
to house-boat, making music to the
guests and indulging in mild badinage with
each other. The moon peered out from the
heavens through a silvery haze, and one by
one the timorous blinking stars grew more
audaciously golden as the night became
darker.</p>

<p>On "The Raft" most of the company disposed
themselves in groups, and boisterously
chorused the musical sentiments of a young
man who had boarded the boat to recite of
love-making on modern methods.  Lady<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
Rolleston, exhausted from the fatigue of
entertaining the indefatigable agriculturist,
sat somewhat apart on a long cane chair.
She fanned herself, and from time to time
applauded. It was a pleasure to contemplate
the boyish zest with which her husband led
the roar. Song after song followed, and
then came a "breakdown" from a young
"Middy," whose spirits were infectious. At
last, when the rampage had almost ceased,
Harry Rolleston became aware of his wife's
silence and exceeding pallor.</p>

<p>"It's awfully late, we must be off, or we
shall face daylight before we know where we
are."</p>

<p>Jovial farewells were exchanged, parting
bets quoted, then the pair descended into
darkness.</p>

<p>The river was now almost deserted; its face
like a black mirror giving forth only exaggerated
reflections of such illuminations as still
glowed along the length of the Reach.
These, however, served well to steer by, and
they neared their own house-boat with little
difficulty. Outside, though the night was
sultry, tiny breezes that came and went fanned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
the skin like the breath of babes. Under the
roof, however, not a whiff of air could
penetrate, and, within the room, the atmosphere
seemed hot and asphyxiating.</p>

<p>Maud Rolleston, as she threw off her gown,
complained.</p>

<p>"The air here is stifling, I should like to
sleep on deck."</p>

<p>"Impossible," her husband said, "you
would have the sun routing you in an hour or
two."</p>

<p>"Then we must keep the door open. I
don't suppose there are burglars about."</p>

<p>"Burglars? I'd like to catch them&mdash;but
damp&mdash;one can't fight that."</p>

<p>"It is too hot to be damp," she asserted,
laying a hand on the frilled pillows of her tiny
bunk.</p>

<p>"But dangerous mists rise up from the
river," he argued, warningly.</p>

<p>"I am not afraid of mists," she said, and in
her long silk bedgown she tripped to the outer
door, opened it, and returned to fling herself in
abandonment of fatigue upon her tiny couch.</p>

<p>As accompaniment to her slumbers the
lapping of the tide against the house-boat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
steps made a soft, incessant music, while the
swishing of reeds by the river bank sighed
a sweet response to the whispered endearments
of the wind. On the air still floated
drowsily the sound of strings from guitars, and
the muffled echo of voices that sang in other
house-boats farther down the stream. Then
by degrees, within the space of an half-hour,
came a greater hush&mdash;the hush of a sleeping
world worn out with laughter and laziness.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>And Maud Rolleston, dreaming, grew paler
under the moonbeams that peered through
the lace shroudings of the narrow window.
She sighed sometimes in her sleep, now and
again lifting her head upon an elbow, as
though to look out on the expanse of water
that purled almost silently to its inevitable
future. Her eyes were open, expressionless,
but tearful. In the crystal seemed a reflection
of the water's suddenly ruffled surface
which the moon was dappling with points of
silver....</p>

<p>By and by she put her feet to the ground,
hesitatingly at first, and then gliding through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
the open door, she stood on an old Moorish
prayer-carpet that covered the head of the
steps. Two nautilus shells holding their
burden of giant mignonette shielded her from
the air; but it broke at times fragrantly from
the scented forest of blossoms.</p>

<p>With a lily in her hand, backgrounded thus
by stars and midnight, she might have represented
a virgin saint on a missal, but her arms
were bare and extended, and she seemed
rather to be a prophetess, a sybil, uttering
invocation.</p>

<p>Her lips scarce moved, but they sighed a
name, "Basil."</p>

<p>The ruffled waters, at the steps of the boat,
swayed and parted. The visage of a dead
man looked out from the depths to her.
His hair hung lank about his brow, the tide
washed it along in passing, as it washed the
weeds from the face of the lilies.</p>

<p>"Basil," she murmured.</p>

<p>"You called to me? Or was it but the
haunting of a name that once did melt like
honey from your lip?"</p>

<p>"I called...."</p>

<p>"Was it the wail of love?&mdash;Ah no,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
perchance it was a sigh&mdash;the pitiful sigh of
happiness compassionate&mdash;happiness regretting
sorrow?..."</p>

<p>"It was love alone that cried."</p>

<p>"Searching?"</p>

<p>"And finding not!"</p>

<p>"But why doth love cry here&mdash;here by the
wet tomb of dead men? what may it find
where the waters slide and shift, and the
fishes twist, and the reeds tangle?"</p>

<p>"Rest."</p>

<p>"Where satins shimmer not, and gems are
few, save those bled from the heart of despair&mdash;frozen
in flowing...."</p>

<p>"The rarest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Where no song ever swells, and the dirge
of the river pleads and pleads for the soul of
faith murdered...."</p>

<p>"And saves it."</p>

<p>"Doth love come here to find rest that no
earth could give, here, in the cradle of the
weeds: to wear jewels, rarer than rubies of
the crown, tears of passion, ice-bound and
spurned? Doth it come to sing the river's
anthem, to wash itself white and holy, and
save its soul for ever?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>"It comes."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Close by among the rushes a wood pigeon
stirred in its sleep and cooed, and the river
at the foot of the house-boat step yawned like
a bath of silver, pale and cold. Over the gulf
swayed the warm, white body of a dreaming
woman. Her arms were flung out, and a soft
sob, sweeter than the dove's note, a sob of rest
and rapture and realisation broke from her
lips.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Far across the fields, the note of the
chanticleer rang out; the gulf closed, the
porch of the house-boat stood empty, and the
moon and the stars paled at what they had
seen. Then they hid their heads and wept in
the dawn.</p>

<div class="poem"><p>
"'Twas only a dream&mdash;a boy's first passion,<br />
A foolish love, and a mock of bliss."<br />
</p></div>


<h4>I.</h4>

<p>His first love; this is what his heart called
her. But his head and a poignant memory
offered many negations. There was, for
instance, the girl who sold papers outside
bounds, when fourteen-year-old effervescence
converted a toast-and-water emotion into
an intoxicating passion. And his best chum,
Harry's sister, whom he had never seen,
but whose photograph had lodged in his
breast pocket&mdash;she, for a short time, had
presided in that revolutionary area called his
heart. He had the photograph still, with its
central yellowy patches, which betrayed
repeated collisions with an ardent nose above
the place aimed at by his moustacheless lips.
When the down began to grow like the
feathers on a nestling bird, there had been
someone else&mdash;a fairy all gauze and wings,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
a chameleon creature that changed her soft
transparencies under the magic of limelight for
a limited sum nightly during the pantomime
season. Being somewhat of an idealist, his
mind retained the fairy element in spite of
rather harsh contradictions in the way of
healthy appetite, indifferent pronunciation,
and dubious finery. Of course he recovered
the illusion, as he had recovered the measles,
and, moreover, allowed his fancy a few other
experimental flights before he encountered
Carol Silver.</p>

<p>The introduction was made by Harry
Burnley at the time when, let loose from
Sandhurst, their movements hung on the voice
of the <i>Gazette</i>; it was made with reluctance,
for Harry was well versed in his friend's
inflammability, and had himself for Carol more
than a brotherly regard. However, the day
was Sunday, and opportunities for detaching
himself from Tyndall being scarce, Harry
could but pursue his customary route to the
Silvers' house, accompanied by his friend and
guest.</p>

<p>But Yate Tyndall was not thrust under fire
without warning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p>"She's an awfully nice girl," jerked his
chum, as they crunched the gravelled drive to
the house; "but it's no good fooling around
in that quarter&mdash;everyone knows she's gone
on Rosser, some say engaged, but I don't
think it's come to that."</p>

<p>"What's he in?" questioned Yate, soldier-like
believing that every man that is a
man and not a vegetable must be "in"
something.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's waiting for the <i>Gazette</i> as we are.
He scraped in through the militia, as much to
his own amazement as to everyone else's."</p>

<p>Yate's opinion of Miss Silver's suitor
shrivelled.</p>

<p>He was himself a mightily clever youngster
who had passed into Sandhurst straight from
the schoolroom. Perhaps fate had favoured
him in providing on the mother's side some
German profundity and on the father's a
sturdy vertebral column and proportionate
wrappings of British muscle; perhaps it had
not, for inside the profundity was a luxuriant
growth of romance, and through the British
muscle coursed subdued but dangerous fires.</p>

<p>"He's a good-looking chap," explained<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Harry&mdash;for Rosser was an old friend&mdash;"a
dashing rider, and a capital shot&mdash;everyone
likes him."</p>

<p>"Lucky fellow," grunted Yate. "I've
often observed that the failures are quite the
most popular."</p>

<p>"Because it's their popularity that does for
them." Harry, who had occupied a humble
position on the nethermost hem of the
Sandhurst list, was conscious that his own
anxiety for cavalry was due rather to the
"beggars can't be choosers" system of the idle
and popular ones than to a direct equestrian
penchant.</p>

<p>"And women pet them; they'd prefer a
fool who can pot rabbits and do a barn-dance
to Homer himself," growled Yate.</p>

<p>"I expect Homer in the flesh was a bit
flabby," said Harry, contemplatively rubbing
the knob of his stick over an immaculate chin.
At this moment the door was opened, and
they were invited to follow straight through
the house to where the conservatory gave on
to a rose garden; Miss Silver and her mother
were there reading, said the maid.</p>

<p>From the top of the steps Yate caught a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
pretty glimpse of Sabbath repose. The lawn
and the standard roses were formal enough,
but there were acacia trees on the left, and,
under them, grouped artistically, an Indian
drugget, a tea table, and long basket chairs.
In one of these Carol lay curled up like the
letter S, with head deep in a frilled cushion.
Harry, from his point of vantage, whispered,
"She reminds me of a lettuce." The soft
green of a shimmering tea gown tipped with
transparencies of lemon-tinted gauze was
gratifying to parched eyes in over-ripe
midsummer.</p>

<p>Yate frowned. He was not on friendly
enough terms to appreciate a joke which
might be overheard.</p>

<p>Harry proceeded to shout a jovial self-announcement,
upon which she lifted her eyes
from what seemed an absorbing theme.</p>

<p>Yate's quick glance, in the moment of
introduction, observed the book was upside
down. Her thoughts had evidently been
fixed on something more intensely earnest
still. Rosser, perhaps, he thought to himself&mdash;he
had already begun to detest Rosser.</p>

<p>Her face brightened when she greeted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
them, and she commenced talking with almost
excited volubility.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you've come."</p>

<p>Harry's expression widened to a grin; his
mouth was one of those expansive ones which
are born grinning. It sealed for him the
reputation of good nature.</p>

<p>"Sunday in the suburbs is such a dull
thing, one feels quite asphyxiated, even to
the marrow," she said, addressing herself to
Harry, and veering weathercock-wise in the
direction of Tyndall.</p>

<p>"I thought ladies saved that day for gossip
and scandal?" said Yate, dropping, after the
fashion of male monsters, into the smallest of
chairs indicated by her. Harry had appropriated
a footstool, which brought his grasshopper
outlines against the green of her gown,
and was already resuming his customary
pastime of sucking the knob of his walking
stick, a survival of babyhood which was
doubtless responsible for the awning-like
upper lip wherein lurked his impressive
joviality.</p>

<p>"Oh, so they do, but at this season of the
year all the women wear their old bonnets and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
their faded summer gowns&mdash;they're not even
worth abusing."</p>

<p>"Then you do enjoy a little vinegar?"
volunteered Yate, with eyes that declared her
all honey.</p>

<p>"No, it's too crude; but I like spice&mdash;just
a pinch or two to leaven appreciation."</p>

<p>Mrs Silver at this moment loomed expansively
in the distance. Harry leapt up
to join her, and only the acacia leaves
above were eavesdroppers to the rest of the
conversation. It flowed evenly, sometimes
stopping against an impedimental stone of
argument&mdash;occasionally gushing with iridescent
bubbles from the force of energetic
collision. Yate was a serious thinker and a
confident talker. Carol had by nature that
light quality of intellectual exuberance which,
ornamental and active as foam, has no kinship
with real erudition. They were speaking of
Yate's career, the first steps, the coveted
Victoria Cross, the laurels, and a warm blush
underlay the bronze of the young soldier's
cheek.</p>

<p>"A year ago," she said, "I was rampant
with your ambition, now I cannot forget<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
that the rungs of a soldier's ladder are
made of dead men."</p>

<p>"What are a few lives compared with a
country's greatness?"</p>

<p>"Only a subtraction from a multiplicity of
mourners whom death rejects, the numberless
babes bereft, the women starved of love."</p>

<p>"Surely love were a petty consideration, a
paralysis to the hand of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't you remember what Byron says?"
she uttered, her glance fastening itself on
the floating mists of sunset, "'Love is of
man's life a thing apart, 'tis woman's whole
existence.' If war costs him his life, it takes
her whole existence too!"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;but&mdash;" stammered Yate,
fighting with a wave of sentimentality deeper
than any to which he had been accustomed,
"women nowadays don't love in that
way."</p>

<p>"The more fools they if they do," she
answered, flippantly, coming abruptly from the
clouds, and flicking at a gnat with the stem
of her fan. "Have some tea, it is iced and
flavoured with lemon peel, <i>a la Russe</i>."</p>

<p>"No tea, thanks. There is Burnley waving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
at us. I think he has an engagement, and
means me to be off."</p>

<p>"Not yet, surely. If you are not booked
for anything you need not hurry."</p>

<p>"Thanks. I should be glad to stay. I
say, Harry, there's no good dragging me to
the Waymans, is there?"</p>

<p>"Besides," interposed Carol, as her mother
approached, "he has not been introduced to
mamma."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," said Burnley, posing
himself with mock formality, "Mrs Silver,
let me present to you my friend Yate Tyndall&mdash;he's
poor but pleasant."</p>

<p>"The fact of poverty is an unpleasantness
of itself," affirmed Yate, extending a hearty
hand to Carol's mother.</p>

<p>The expression of the salutation was
scarcely valedictory, and Harry Burnley
found himself doomed to solitary departure.</p>


<h4>II.</h4>

<p>There was&mdash;after the manner of suburban
vogue&mdash;a tennis club in Weytown. To this
the <i>&eacute;lite</i> of Weytown society, composed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
mostly of shelved officers in various degrees of
dilapidation, and their growing families,
belonged. Here the Burnleys and Silvers
had met, from the years of teetotum to those
of flirtation, and here, outside the cabalistically
marked acre, in their search for truant tennis
balls, had Carol and Rosser commenced the
engagement which some said was serious, and
others declared to be but a boy and girl
pastime.</p>

<p>When the Burnleys' visitor, Yate Tyndall,
appeared upon the scene, which he did almost
immediately after his introduction to the
Silvers, there was spoon diet for the gossips in
plenty. Where Carol was, there the six feet
two of the lumbering youth perambulated also;
where she was not&mdash;and the colour of her
caprices was changeable as the iridescence of
soap-suds&mdash;there, <i>pro tem.</i>, was the soldierly
figure extinct.</p>

<p>Burnley laughed, then he chaffed, then he
warned. Reminiscences of Rosser were
flaunted, dabbed forth like blisters, their
unpleasantness being excused by their curative
intent; but to no avail. Then Harry, never
tolerant of home tattle, suddenly lent himself<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
as its mouthpiece. Carol was a flirt&mdash;nay,
more; Rosser, her childhood's one chum, her
girlhood's sweetheart, had been but two
months absent, and she had picked up with,
to her, the merest stranger, etc. etc. Harry
further hinted at spiderly instincts, and
hummed, "Will you walk into my parlour"
somewhat portentously. The fact was that
there was slight abrasion of his own heart's
surface, but that he overlooked to view
himself heroically, as most of us do, and
believed his animus was purely in the interest
of his friend. But the friend rejected
salvation&mdash;flouted it&mdash;and in a few days the
subject was emphatically&mdash;Yate could be
repulsively emphatic when roused&mdash;closed
between them.</p>

<p>On the tennis ground Carol and her new
admirer made an almost daily group. They
seldom played, but they wore flannels in compliment
to the surroundings, and dallied with
time in talking what one, at least, of them
believed to be philosophy. But, as before said,
Carol's moods were never stationary. She had
a mischievous wit and an effervescent, infectious
sprightliness about her&mdash;it was a constitutional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
characteristic rather than the immediate outcome
of gaiety. This made acquaintances
consider her one of the happiest girls in the
world. But of late her friends were prone to
notice a suspicious drowsy pinkness of the
eyelids, a sad pucker of the lip corners which
argued complexly with the gusts of exuberance
that followed any fit of pre-occupation. And
Yate, as he grew in knowledge of her, could
have testified to other moods still&mdash;ugly ones&mdash;had
he not been too neck-deep in emotion,
too loyal, too profoundly worshipful of the
secrets of Nature to notice anything but beauty
in the characteristics of an ungarnished reality
like hers. Besides this, though he was but
a youth, he had cosmopolitan blood in his
veins, and cosmopolitan dilution means poetry
at a very early age&mdash;poetry which clothes
womanhood with mystery, and makes her a
ravishing mixture of puny weakness and
irresistible strength. To him she was the
handwriting on the wall of Belshazzar, a sign
for wonderment and awe and dumb prostration,
a problem too sublime for solution, though the
key to many exalted enigmas lay, alas! merely
with Rosser.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>Of this Yate suspected a little&mdash;a very
little. He never fully knew&mdash;nor indeed did
she&mdash;how far the man was responsible for the
development of the ineradicable events which
crowded that autumn-tinted period. Once he
spoke of him. It was when they had rambled
from the tennis regions to where the edge of
an adjacent common was banked with trees and
dotted with seats arabesqued with initials by
the playful penknives of holiday hordes. She
had been capricious all day&mdash;moody, petulant&mdash;snappish,
in vulgar phrase.</p>

<p>"Won't you tell me what bothers you?" he
said, addressing the coil of her hair, for her
face was bent to some hieroglyphics traced by
her sunshade in the sandy ground.</p>

<p>"You!" she blurted.</p>

<p>"Shall I go?" he asked, meekly. "I've
offered to do so often if it would make you
happier."</p>

<p>"It wouldn't&mdash;nothing would make me
happier."</p>

<p>"Why are you miserable?"</p>

<p>"I'm not," she muttered, and a heavy
tear fell with a thud on the back of her
glove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>He lifted the hand to his lips and kissed
away the drop before it had time to sink
in.</p>

<p>"Would it make you glad to know that if
this were poison I would take it, to share
even so much of you?"</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> poison, rank, acid poison, straight
out of my wicked heart&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Then empty it; let me drain it, that
there may be room for nothing but love."</p>

<p>"Love is a vaster emptiness&mdash;it is only a
shadow thrown by ourselves."</p>

<p>"You have proved it so?" he questioned,
anxiously. "You have loved?"</p>

<p>"I have loved," she breathed, with a weary
accent on the middle word.</p>

<p>There was a long pause while they looked
intently into the evening mists, which were
weaving themselves into a veil of purple
tissue over the horizon. A horrible tremor
had seized him, and his next words, when
they found voice, came thickly out from the
burial place of a sob.</p>

<p>"Was it&mdash;was it Rosser?"</p>

<p>She merely bowed her head without looking
at him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span></p>

<p>He rose mutely, stretched his arms to right
and left, drew himself to full length like some
huge dog wakened from slumber, then for
some moments he stood with hands clenched
on his stick before he spoke.</p>

<p>"I suppose it must be 'good-bye.'"...</p>

<p>She looked at him dreamily.</p>

<p>"Need it?"</p>

<p>He leapt to her side.</p>

<p>"Do you mean that you do not want me
to go&mdash;that you would rather I stayed?"</p>

<p>"Much rather."</p>

<p>"And he?"</p>

<p>"He has ceased to exist for me!"</p>

<p>A torrent of hot blood seemed to burst from
Yate's frozen brain, as watershoots from the
glaciers in summer.</p>

<p>"God! have you given him up?"</p>

<p>"I made a misstatement. I should have
said <i>I have ceased to exist for him</i>."</p>

<p>"That means that you love him?"</p>

<p>She faced round angrily.</p>

<p>"How dare you suggest such things of me?
Do you think that women like I are made the
same as slippers, to wait till footsore wanderers
have need of them? Do you imagine I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
waste an eyelash in weeping for milk wantonly
spilt?"</p>

<p>"Yet you cried?" he ventured, very softly.</p>

<p>"I cried from desolation. Can't you understand
the loss of the illusion being more
lamentable even than the loss of the reality?
Come, let us go back," she added, "it is
growing dark."</p>

<p>They wandered homewards lingeringly.
The summer dusk was full of sweet mystery,
of hazy, promising indefinitude; the heath led
to the high road, and from thence they came
under the darkness of trees, copper-beech and
acacia trees, which made a fringed avenue
along the back of the Silvers' orchard.</p>

<p>They halted as they reached the wicket.
Each longed to express something, but the
something was in so many volumes they could
not decide whence to light on their quotation.
At last she said:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel you are good and loyal and true. I
wish I were worthy you."</p>

<p>He took her hand in his wide palms and
smiled.</p>

<p>"Don't flatter me&mdash;if flattery it can be
called.  I question whether saintliness in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
broadcloth is lovable; but I appreciate the
compliment the more for its being undeserved."</p>

<p>"Boy, you are frivolous; if you weren't so
good I should not have qualms about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do you know," he interposed abruptly,
"how the Orientals prostrate themselves
before their divinity? I would do more."</p>

<p>He flung himself on the ground at her feet,
his forehead against the earth, and with a
quick touch placed his head beneath her heel.</p>

<p>She uttered a sharp cry and stooped to him&mdash;to
lift him. Had it been Rosser's, she
thought, the act would have loomed magnificent;
as it was, the combined self-abasement&mdash;the
devotion, the allegiance of it&mdash;was
crude and colourless. For her there were
no passionate illuminations to preserve the
margin of the sublime. She had argued love
to be but the shadow cast by ourselves, and at
that moment her soul's lamp lighted only
conceptions that were blurred, formless, and
grotesque.</p>

<p>But as he rose he caught her in his arms,
and she did not resist them. She lay inert,
like a wounded animal after long strife, and
pleaded as though for physical or mental refuge.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>"Make me love you! Make me love you!"</p>

<p>And so he kissed her.</p>

<p>It was a kiss that might have awakened a
statue to tenderness. The wine of her lips, as
he pressed and bruised and crushed them,
intoxicated him. He forgot Rosser.</p>


<h4>III.</h4>

<p>The next day a stone Galatea faced the
mirror. There was a purple stain upon her
mouth&mdash;a tiny swelling that would not
disappear. It was scarcely perceptible, but it
burnt brand-like on her heart; it glared at, and
mocked her, and seemed to beckon with
horrible witch-like fingers along the grimy
gutters that fringe the paved paths to despair.</p>

<p>Loveless surrender! What more unredeemed
debasement! Yet she would have
vowed her being to lifelong slavery for Gordon
Rosser's sake, and held such sacrifice but
glorification. One kiss! What was it? Was
it gold or was it mud? Mud, mud, mud,
which only the magic of love's alchemy could
transmute to gold and pearl. Yet the mud
had served its purpose. Was it not sufficient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
to defile the temple that had been consecrated
to an unworthy idol, break down its altars,
obliterate all memory of misguided worship&mdash;child-like,
unreasoning faiths?</p>

<p>But her revenge&mdash;her curse on the falsity
had come home to roost. It not only branded
her&mdash;it seared the innocent! Poor, poor
Yate! What had he done that a suffering
girl should have clung to him to avert mental
death in an ocean of despond, while he had
imagined it but a dancing duet on the waves
of love? And she had aided the deception.
It had been to gain time, to kill regret, to help
in wrenching the weeds she had mistaken for
flowers from the garden of her life. Well,
she had failed, and the travesty must cease.
But before it ceased that which she had
striven to do as a duty to herself she would
now do as a duty to Yate. She chose paper
and a pen with deliberation, and wrote very
proportionately and legibly:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Mr. Rosser</span>,&mdash;Pray do not consider yourself
bound to return as you suggested, and resume our childish
relations. Your long silence has proved you now know
your own mind, and I have already found someone worthy
of a woman's esteem and affection.&mdash;Your sincere friend,</p>

<p style='text-align:right'><span class="smcap">Carol Silver.</span></p>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p>She reserved the posting till night, after
the coming of Yate, who was due at dinner.
In the evening the young man arrived. He
had fought his way on foot through a deluge
of rain and a thundering blast. The tussle
suited his mood, which had rebelled against
the suavity of conveyance to his enchanting
goal. A handsome colour glowed through
the tan of his cheeks, and the sombre green-grey
of his eyes shone gallant and golden with
the illuminations of love. At first glimpse of
him Carol recognised in his personality that
almost godlike quality which welds mere dust
into heroes. What devotion he was prepared
to give her! A crown of sovereignty to lift
the chosen one above princes and peoples,
pain and penury, and privation. But the
diadem was too large, too massive; her poor
ignoble head might sink under it. And then
princes and peoples would become but a
mob, antagonistic or inane, and the pinch of
pain, privation, and penury would eternally
grip at the strings of her love-famished
heart.</p>

<p>She showed him her renouncement of
Rosser, and sent it forth to post. His heart<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
bounded, for her composure deceived him and
masked the cost of the decisive action.</p>

<p>After dinner, Mrs Silver, complaining of the
elements outside and the leaden temperature
within, retired to lie down in the adjacent
boudoir. They were alone. On a distant
pedestal a lamp, petalled like a poppy, threw
sleepy rays across the room; at the piano
some smaller flowers leant their rose blush to
the winking candles. She was seated at the
keys in a gown, gauzy white, with two dreamy
hands expressing some twilight theme of
Schumann's&mdash;a reverie of sorrow and sighing.
He sat passive, but it was the passivity of the
spinning-top. His greedy eyes looked at the
wandering fingers and longed to detain them,
leant on the mignonette which cast a languid
breath from the muslin folds of her bodice&mdash;fastened
gladly, almost possessively, on the
tiny blue speck that marred the outline of her
under lip. Poor sweet speck! Oh, that it
might there remain for ever as seal royal of
the eternity of his truth! At last she lifted
her hands and rose. He rose in sympathy
and advanced, half afraid; restrained by
the indefinable awe with which we all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
approach joys that are too delicious to be
seized.</p>

<p>For a moment she scanned him earnestly
but not regretfully, and, as she gazed, she
noted the passage of his eyes as they travelled
conqueror-wise to the dark flaw on the
margin of her mouth. His glance let loose
the words that had swelled her heart with
pent-up purpose.</p>

<p>She held out her hand. He grasped it
eagerly; but there was a stiff wrist and elbow
at the back of it which dictated the distance
from him to her.</p>

<p>"Yate&mdash;Mr Tyndall&mdash;I want you to go
away!"</p>

<p>"What!&mdash;now?&mdash;this moment?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and for ever!"</p>

<p>She spoke deliberately, without a quaver of
sorrow, and every word on his heart spat like
hailstones coming down a chimney on live
coal.</p>

<p>His huge frame trembled and swayed an
instant. Then he laughed. It was a jarring,
joyless convulsion.</p>

<p>"You don't mean it&mdash;you are doing it to
try me&mdash;say you don't, Carol, my darling."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I do," she explained. "Listen. I
have behaved infamously to you. I will take
all the blame. You were so good, so noble, so
loving. You came just when I was dying of
heartbreak&mdash;people do die of it, no matter
what the philosophers say. You saved me,
you lifted me to life and womanly pride, you
prevented me from writing cringing letters
to&mdash;&mdash;in short you saved me from throwing
myself at Mr Rosser's head. Nay, don't
speak. I told you I had loved him."</p>

<p>"You love him still!" he cried.</p>

<p>"No. I showed you my letter this evening
to prove it. But that is no reason for loving
you."</p>

<p>"But you'll try and love me? I would
make you&mdash;you said I might," he murmured,
as though coaxing trust from a child.</p>

<p>"No," she said, disengaging her hand
and brushing it across her eyes as if to sweep
away a blighting memory. "No, it was then
I knew myself, then I took courage to face
the future without him&mdash;without you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But because you refuse him, why&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I will not become a thief. Because my
own gold has been filched and squandered I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
should be no less a thief were I to fill my
purse with what I can never earn&mdash;never
repay."</p>

<p>"My love is a free gift, Carol&mdash;I don't make
reservations," he mumbled, hopelessly, for he
knew her tones dictated rather than argued.</p>

<p>"Won't you see that it is because your gift
is so lavish, so rare&mdash;because I cannot return&mdash;I
cannot take it? Offerings of real worth
cannot be so accepted without degradation.
Dear Yate, good-bye. Some day when you
have recovered this you will know I am right.
Perhaps, even, you may place me, faults and
all, in some special heart-niche reserved for
defunct yet exotic truths."</p>

<p>She affected flippancy, but her mirth hung
lank, like the curls of a drowning man.</p>

<p>He bent over her hand and kissed it.</p>

<p>Then he said thickly, in a drunkard's voice,
"I'll go ... by the garden way&mdash;&mdash;"
and rushed out.</p>

<p>She heard the conservatory door bang
behind him, and lost the sound of his
footsteps in the howl of the storm.</p>

<p>They took him over the soaking lawn,
along the orchard, out by the wicket, into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
avenue of copper-beech and acacia where last
night they had stood together. There he
beat his head against the senseless bark of the
dripping trees and wept aloud. And the
burst of his sobs mingled with the roaring of
the wind as it swept over him and expended
its wild tumult against the closed windows of
her house.</p>

<h2>Twin Souls (Dialogue).</h2>


<h4><i>Characters.</i></h4>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ardilaun Vyse</span>, <i>a popular poet; and</i> <span class="smcap">Cynicus
Neere</span>, <i>an old bachelor.</i></p>


<h4><span class="smcap">Scene&mdash;A Smoking-Room.</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> I can't think why we discuss it.
It's as useless to expect sentiment from you
as&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> To import coals to Newcastle.
Who hawks goods in a stocked market?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> One likes sympathy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> I sympathise profoundly; but
talking about a leak doesn't stop it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> This can't be stopped. It means
the wreck of two lives&mdash;Letitia's and mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Together?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Together! Why, the universe
would be re-created! It is severment that
ruins. There is she, brilliant, beautiful,
famous, tied for life to a money-grubber on
'Change: a wretch who cuts the leaves of
her books with his thumb, and snores over
them like an apoplectic pug.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> He earns his dose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Money again! That's all you
think of&mdash;it's all my wife thinks about.
Petty parsimonies, cramping retrenchments,
harrowing details of household economy&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Very necessary, even in the
<i>menage</i> of a popular poet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> They needn't be flaunted. To
come in and read your most brilliant
stanzas to a woman who never looks up
from darning&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Your socks?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> When you know of another who
would listen to every word and criticise&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Pick holes, not mend them!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Who would share your highest
exaltations and lift you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Off your feet, till you bashed your
crown against the hard fact of orthodox
opinion.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> What is opinion to souls the law
of the higher intelligence has made twin?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> A thorny briar, with twenty
prickles to the rose.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> What were a thousand prickles
to one such rose?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> I concede, Letitia is too fine a
prize to be lost for a scratch&mdash;a thousand
scratches.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Well said&mdash;now you speak like a
man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> She must be grasped and all the
little spikes allowed to probe their way
through the skin. You can rise at cock-crow
and salve your wounds with morning
dew&mdash;you rival the lark sometimes, don't
you?&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Nothing to laugh at. I find my
best inspirations at sunrise, when the first
glow of day blushes through the trees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus</span> (<i>scratching his chin and looking at
the ceiling</i>). Letitia sleeps till nine. Her inspirations
blaze best in moonlight. At dawn
her rest commences and is never broken&mdash;no,
not even by the "apoplectic pug." He slinks
off on tip-toe to his money-grubbing in the
city.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Does she work so hard?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Books like Letitia's are not written
without mental strain. Poets may weave, like
spiders, from their innermost, but authors
grind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Noble woman! Yet she shows
no signs of fatigue.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> The "pug" again. Snacks before
she goes out, snacks when she comes home;
oysters and stout at eleven, by his orders.
Saves the digestion and helps to recuperate,
he thinks.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> But eating in the usual way&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Couldn't be done by genius; nothing
so conventional.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Me you put outside the
pale?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Oh no; you've your vagaries,
though not as to time. How about the
vegetarian diet and distilled water?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> The simplicity of the philosophers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Troublesome to keep going?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Not so; my meals are perfect&mdash;fit
for a king.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Your wife's recipes, I suppose?
Our English cooks are dolts at vegetable
dressing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> They are. She superintends&mdash;she
prefers cookpots to poetry. That is the
hard part of it. Were it Letitia&mdash;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> The vegetables might go to
the&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Nothing of the kind. A clever
woman could master such trivial details in a
trice.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> And pen her books with a squint
eye on the saucepan?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> You say she only works at night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> And your matutinal repast?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> My milk and lentils at eight&mdash;anyone
could manage that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> And Letitia's coffee and roll in
bed at nine, her <i>d&eacute;jeuner &agrave; la Fourchette</i> at
eleven, your lunch at one, her snack at four,
your tea at five&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Come, you're overdrawing it.
We should at least have dinner together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Yes; Letitia is what you call a
flesh-eater and wine-bibber like myself. We'd
have a good square meal, finishing up with
some fine "fruity." I forgot; in the ideal
household the "pug's" noted port would be
conspicuous by its absence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Poets don't gamble to fill their
cellars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> So they go empty. Poor Letitia!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Letitia would prefer love to the
rarest vintage that was ever pressed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> How about the machinery? The
nectar of the gods won't drive a cog-wheel.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> I suppose I have machinery, as
you call it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Greased on special principles,
too. Drop your principles and bang goes
everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Puns won't silver your moral
bolus. You can't convince me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Morally? I don't attempt to, but
practically I can show you it is one thing to
love flowers, rave over their colour and scent,
and another to crack your spine in digging
and hoeing, watering, slug-catching, and all
the rest of it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> You've shifted your premises.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> Pardon me; instead of preaching
I used the Kodak. Tableau: Two precious
exotics; to right, the "pug," armed with
spade and watering-pot; to left, your wife,
darning-needle in hand, impaling slugs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ardilaun.</span> Bosh! You're too irritating for
words; I'm off. (<i>Exit in a rage.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cynicus.</span> To develop the negative, eh?</p>

<p>The little travelling clock on his mantel
struck with soft, gong-like chime; it seemed
to speak from a great way off, like a person
facing you, who answers your questions with
an absent eye. Half-past six, and he was
due from the Continent every moment. His
lamp&mdash;green-shaded because his vision was
weak from over-work&mdash;some soda water and
a spirit stand were awaiting him on the table,
and a small mass of letters and papers was
congregated in front of his chair. All these
were tones in the gamut of expectation that
found its keynote in myself.</p>

<p>We had been "inseparables" before his
going, and we would be so never again I felt
convinced. She had absorbed him: mind,
desire, future were packed in the little palm
of her hand. Yet I was not vulgarly jealous.
I loved Aubrey Yeldham better than I could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
have loved a brother, but I had seen her and
had caught the reflection of his sentiment,
though in a tempered degree. I had met her
but once, for on the day after our chance
encounter&mdash;in a verdurous Devon lane where
she had lost her bearings and we had come to
her assistance&mdash;I had been summoned to the
bedside of a sick relative in town. Returning
to the old haunts, I naturally expected to
resume our fishing expeditions in the
picturesque valley of the Exe, but I soon
discovered Yeldham to have found other
pellucid purple depths that interested him
superlatively. I had watched the drama from
a distance, and administered cautions with the
cool pulse of an umpire. But he was past
redemption. I suspected the truth when I
made an impressionist sketch of her&mdash;milky
complexion, dead copper chevelure and pulpy
eyelids like some Greuze dreamer&mdash;and saw
his greedy eyes fixed on the canvas, not
daring to name a price, too delicate to crave
a charitable dole. I learnt more from the
attitude of reverence, almost of awe, wherewith
he received the gift from my hands and
hurriedly carried it to his own sanctum, hid it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
from me, the maker of it, as though to veil
its charms from alien eye. I knew Aubrey
Yeldham well, had shared many of his
escapades, and winked apprehensively at
others. But here I was of no use, and
decided we had come to the supreme moment
of life&mdash;there is always one&mdash;when we must
let things slide.</p>

<p>Her name was Ruth Lascelles, and she was
a widow; that was the sum total of our knowledge
of her. She might have been twenty, but
we estimated her age at twenty-five, deducing
our theory from a certain fatigued languor of
voice and expression that accorded ill with the
girlish satin of her skin. This was arrived
at on the first day of our meeting&mdash;we had
not discussed her since. I had not been
Yeldham's friend, his disciple, a mental sitter
at his feet, without learning to walk warily
where the fuse of his passions flickered. For
some time there was a tacit agreement to
ignore the impending danger, to talk of
trivialities, wheeling round the central idea
without ever settling there. But one morning
when he had called at the little farm cottage
where she lived and had found her flown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
without a word or a regret, his despair had
been too much for him. The whole story
rolled from his lips: his love for her, her seeming
reciprocity, their wanderings in the woods,
her reliant, trusting attitude&mdash;which had
taught him to wish himself some knight of
the Round Table and not a mere besmirched
man of many passions&mdash;her flutterings of
childish gaiety and sombre philosophy that
had tinted her speech garishly as rainbows
on thunder-clouds: he gave forth all, and
asked, with an expression jejune as Sahara,
what the sudden flight could mean.</p>

<p>I was so out of it, as the phrase is, that
I could volunteer small elucidation: that she
was a coquette of the first order seemed the
most feasible solution, and I offered it. He
derided the notion&mdash;it was apparently so
frivolous a venture that it failed to anger
him&mdash;he never set hands on the cudgels for
defence. "She is not shallow," he had
merely said, and his poor brain had tackled
the enigma so often and to so little purpose
that its purport had become an unmeaning
and vacuous reiteration. But one day, after
we had returned to town and were working<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
well in harness, he with his book, I with my
illustrations for it, he burst out afresh.</p>

<p>"She unintentionally let out where she
lived: it is a little village on the coast of
France. She must have returned."</p>

<p>"Well?" I said, suspending my work and
pretending to extract a hair from the fine point
of my drawing-pen.</p>

<p>"Well," he burst out, "the world is our
oyster, and if we shirk opening it we can't
hope to filch pearls!"</p>

<p>"That means?" I hinged expectantly.</p>

<p>"That means, in plain words, that I don't
intend to give up the biggest pearl that God
ever sent to make a man rich."</p>

<p>"You intend to follow her?" I questioned&mdash;needlessly,
indeed, for his kindling eye contained
a fire of decision and energy that for
fourteen days, since the sorry one of her
disappearance, had smouldered.</p>

<p>"Yes, follow her, make her love me by
every art, divine or devilish&mdash;I don't care
which, so long as she loves me&mdash;and keep her
till the same grave closes over us."</p>

<p>And he went.</p>

<p>He had been absent but a week when I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
received the telegram announcing his intended
return. I stood&mdash;with my back against the
mantel, and hands warming themselves behind
my sheltering coat-tails&mdash;eager to recognise
his rampant mount of the stairs, to feel the
clasp of his hand or its thump on my
shoulder-blade, and hear his cheery "Congratulate
me, old fellow!" that I knew must
come. A cab stopped outside, and a key
turned in the lock. Then a slow, heavy tread
ascended. We met in the passage. There
was no need for more than a glance at him to
abridge the exuberance of welcome that had
bubbled to my lips. I settled with the cabman,
and in a cowardly fashion lingered
unduly outside among the rugs and the
travelling impedimenta. I felt somehow that
he would prefer to come face to face with his
home in silence. He drank a pretty stiff dose
of brandy before sitting down, and moved the
lamp away from his eyes.</p>

<p>"Letters," I indicated.</p>

<p>"Bother letters! Open them or throw
them in the fire."</p>

<p>I did neither, but transferred them to his
bureau. Then, seeing he was disinclined for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
conversation, I relit my old briar pipe that had
been suffered to go out, and lolled in an arm-chair
facing the fender. Presently I surveyed
him from the side of an eye. His chin was
sunk on his chest, he was staring at his boots
with the blank look of a gambler who has
staked his last. There was something in his
attitude that made me wish myself a dog or a
woman, that I might lick, or croon, or croodle
some softness into that stony mask. The
silence was so long&mdash;so pregnant with unsyllabled
anguish&mdash;that at last I closed a warm
hand over his fingers as they clasped the arm-end
of his chair.</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"Well," he said, huskily, starting a little
from his coma and poking a coal with the toe
of his boot, "it's over."</p>

<p>"So I suppose; and the pearl was not&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not for my handling," he interrupted.
"I knew you'd think something hard of her,
but you won't, you won't when I tell
you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stretched his hand to his glass and
emptied it before continuing.</p>

<p>"It came about sooner than I intended&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
horizon was so serene I wanted to lay-to
for a bit&mdash;but it was no use. We were talking
of something&mdash;I forget what&mdash;and I made a
quotation. You know the chap who said,
'Show me a woman's clothes at different
periods of her life and I will tell you her
history'?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I forget his name, but I think it was
a Frenchman."</p>

<p>"Well, I quoted him. Pretended to a like
perspicacity: it was a sneaking, cowardly ruse
to know more of her."</p>

<p>"Had she told you nothing?"</p>

<p>"All this week I had known no more than
what we both knew or surmised&mdash;that there
was a secret panel somewhere."</p>

<p>"And in your tapping for hollows&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"The spring flew; yes, but not as you
suppose. I pretended that a sight of even a
few of her past dresses might suggest a
fragmentary romance, though of course she
was too young for histories such as were
meant by the originator of the idea. She is
only twenty-four," he parenthesised, "was
married at nineteen; I learnt that."</p>

<p>"Well?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span></p>

<p>"She snapped at my offer&mdash;was almost
ardent in her wish to test me.</p>

<p>"'I could show you the most important
dresses I have worn in the last seven years,'
she said. 'I used to clothe myself in gowns
to match my moods at one time,' she added.</p>

<p>"I saw myself face to face with the last
fence, and baulked. I began backing out.
There were soft places, I could not tell how
deep or how soft, beyond, and I was nervous.</p>

<p>"'Come,' she urged, spurring with almost
excited insistence, 'if you outline with the
smallest correctness I will supply the lights
and shades truthfully.'</p>

<p>"She said the last words with pathetic
emphasis that frightened me.</p>

<p>"I determined to change the subject.
Caught the little finger of her left hand and
kissed it. Did I tell you she had never shaken
hands with me with her right&mdash;that she had
explained she kept it for secular and the other
for sacred use? I kissed it, in the centre of
her palm, and her body curled like a sensitive
plant with the warmth of my lips. I blushed
for having doubted her purity or her love."</p>

<p>He buried his head in his hands and seemed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
disinclined to reveal more. But after a long
pause he began afresh.</p>

<p>"I'm telling you everything&mdash;exactly as
it happened&mdash;that you may reverence her.
She's too clean and transparent to be clouded
by vulgar doubt," he said, rather to himself
than to me.</p>

<p>"She insisted on my accompanying her to
a sparsely-furnished room," he went on.
"The walls were fitted with hooks and slides
to improvise a wardrobe.</p>

<p>"'I have kept some of my gowns since I
was a girl,' she sighed.</p>

<p>"'Those, I suppose, that were episodic?'
I affected to laugh to waive her seriousness.</p>

<p>"'Oh, the everyday ones were thrown
away&mdash;worn out: these were most of them
connected with'&mdash;she hesitated&mdash;'eventful
occasions.'</p>

<p>"I again wavered&mdash;allusions to these eventful
occasions seemed to portend grief to her
and pain incidentally to me.</p>

<p>"I caught her wrist as it turned the handle
of the wardrobe door, and remonstrated. 'I
refuse to see them; I know nothing of clothes
and I'm not a detective, I won't pry into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
your past secrets, either of sorrow or of
joy.'</p>

<p>"Her hand shook in my clasp.</p>

<p>"'Don't stop me,' she cried, imperatively.
'Help me&mdash;I want you to know them.'</p>

<p>"'So be it,' I said, and pushed back the
door. Then she suddenly flung herself in
front of it, between me and the row of dainty
frocks and shimmering laces. She looked like
Cassandra&mdash;in a soft, yellowy flannel gown
with loose sleeves falling away from her pink
arms that blushed with the heaving blood in
her warm breasts&mdash;like Cassandra guarding
the gate of a citadel, though her lips said in a
tone richer than wine, sweeter than music,
'Kiss me first.'"</p>

<p>There was a long pause&mdash;Yeldham sat
blankly staring at the coals, and I gazed
intently into the mists of nicotine that curled
upwards to the ceiling. Through them I
could conjure a vision of her bronzed coronal
and Aubrey's massive muscularity, and could
picture her glowing arms around his neck&mdash;a
convolvulus entwining a Gothic column.</p>

<p>"There are some kisses," he said presently,
"that are worth the whole sum of human<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
pleasure. Pleasure! Faugh!&mdash;a rotten
word&mdash;belonging to those who only half live!"</p>

<p>He handled a cigarette mechanically and lit
it.</p>

<p>"Well," he continued, "the first dress was
white. A virginal thing of simple gauze and
flummery, with a frontage of puffings to make
up for bust development. Quite a girl's dress.
Women, you know, are less generous in the
matter of&mdash;chiffon, don't they call it?&mdash;and
more so in the matter of flesh. It was
her deb&ucirc;t dress&mdash;I supposed&mdash;but she
contradicted.</p>

<p>"'No,' she explained, 'not quite that.
One's deb&ucirc;t is a hazy affair: all excitement,
wonder, blush, and clumsiness, with little or no
enjoyment. Yet how many of us would give
the long, grey end of life for that first night's
dappling of peach bloom? It was the frock I
wore on the evening I first met my husband.'</p>

<p>"She spoke his name with a dull accent
of grief, and I buried myself amongst the
flippery. Her kiss was moist on my lips, and
I had no taste for allusions to the dead man.</p>

<p>"The next thing was a riding habit&mdash;torn
across the skirt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"'A cropper,' I remarked; 'and enjoyed, or
this memento would scarcely be here?'</p>

<p>"'That,' she allowed, sadly, 'is a natural
inference&mdash;correct in this case, but not in all.'
I glanced hurriedly along the line for relics of
crape&mdash;but she resumed my enlightenment.
'This was a souvenir of a grand day's hunting
and a broken ankle.'</p>

<p>"'And someone?' I hinted.</p>

<p>"'Yes; George&mdash;my husband&mdash;carried me
home.'</p>

<p>"I turned abruptly to a party frock&mdash;the
colour of a rose. There was a green patch on
the right breast&mdash;the blurr of crushed flowers.</p>

<p>"'No occasion to state what this means,' I
snapped irritably. I was seized with a desire
to close the wardrobe on these trophies of
conquest.</p>

<p>"'No,' she said, with a quiver of the lips,
'we were married soon after.'</p>

<p>"I threw myself into an arm-chair in the
sulks, but she moved on to show another gown&mdash;a
bed or invalid gown&mdash;worn and faded.</p>

<p>"'An illness,' I said; 'you had no strength
left for coquetry?'</p>

<p>"'Puerperal fever,' she explained. 'My<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
baby died, and my brain&mdash;it seemed to get
paroxysms of depression and exaltation.
Don't you think that a supernatural power
ordains our moods, shifts the evenness of
balance, makes us sometimes irresponsible?'</p>

<p>"There was a lambent excitement in her
manner, which was usually gentle, almost
lethargic.</p>

<p>"'We can't be responsible for our brains
in illness, particularly fever. But you
recovered?' I said, pointing to some fine
azure drapery encrusted with Japanese
gold.</p>

<p>"'I recovered; yes, but I never wore that.'</p>

<p>"'It belonged to someone you loved?'</p>

<p>"'It was mine,' she said, 'and was worn by
a woman I hated. She borrowed it one night
after coming over in the rain; she used to
attend me devotedly during my illness.'</p>

<p>"'Yet you hated her?' I asked, taking my
cue from the curl of her lip.</p>

<p>"'Not then. In those days I thought men
were true&mdash;George truest of all&mdash;and women
good.'</p>

<p>"I smiled, but she was quite serious.</p>

<p>"'In this way;' she explained, 'I imagined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
that if they sinned, it was either for sheer
love or for bare life.'</p>

<p>"I looked down at the gold storks on the
heavy eastern silk, and said, 'And when did
you change your opinion?'</p>

<p>"'When I hung away this gown, and determined
it should never touch me.'</p>

<p>"'This woman showed you a new type?'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' she replied, very simply, 'she
neither loved nor starved.'</p>

<p>"For a long time the poor girl remained
mute, staring at the ill-fated blue garment,
and one of white cambric that hung the last
on the hooks. I rose to put my arm round
her, to break the skein of unpleasant associations,
but she moved away, and said in a hard,
almost defiant, voice:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'There is one more; tell me its tale if you
can, and if not&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"She paused while I took the fine lace and
lawn into my fingers; it seemed a summer
dress, scarcely crushed; in front, however, and
on the sleeve was a splash of dull red-brown.</p>

<p>"'Paint?' I suggested, 'or blood. An
accident, perhaps?' and in questioning I met
her eyes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Don't, don't!' I cried, 'don't speak!'
I flung myself back in the chair, and covered
my face to avoid the sight of hers&mdash;the
expression of horror that was staring from
it.</p>

<p>"'I will, I must speak. Yes, blood; his
blood. Oh!' she exclaimed, standing in front
of me in that Cassandra-like attitude I had
noticed before, 'I can see it now. George had
gone to the country&mdash;so he had said&mdash;and I,
to pass the time, dined with an uncle
at Bignards. You know the room&mdash;the
thousand lights and loaded tables, the chink of
glass and glow of silver&mdash;the gay and brilliant
company that is always there? We dined,
and were leaving afterwards for the Opera.
My uncle passed out first, and I was about to
follow him, when, at a little table <i>a deux</i>, I
saw George and her; George looking down,
down into her eyes and her bosom, with a hot
red flush in his cheeks, and a lifted wine-glass
in his hand. I don't know what happened;
I burst between them, flung the glass from his
fingers, and then&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"I thought she must scream, but only a gasp
escaped her. She looked at something on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
ground and added in an awed, strangely
intense voice, 'He was dead!'</p>

<p>"The tone compelled me to her side; a
torrent of agony seemed frozen at her lips.</p>

<p>"'Hush! Hush!' I implored. 'Your brain
was deranged: you had been ill&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"I had recovered. Did you never read of
the Reymond affair? I am that miserable
woman. Lucky, some people have called me,
because in France they are human and class
such deeds as <i>crimes passionels</i>.'</p>

<p>"My words I cannot remember. They
were violent reiterations of love, assurances
that I had read and recalled the catastrophe&mdash;the
fatal result of a glass splint probing an
artery&mdash;and had pitied her before I knew her.
I protested, raved, threatened, vowed I had
come with the one object of linking my life to
hers, and that now, more than ever, my mind
was fixed.</p>

<p>"But she remained cold, almost severe.
'You remember,' she said, 'how I fled from
you to spare myself a Tantalus torture&mdash;a
hungering for spiritual peace, a thirsting for
rare devotion which you seemed to be offering
with laden hands?'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Your longings must have been slight!'
I scoffed, ungenerously.</p>

<p>"'Listen,' she cried, still standing rigid,
though the thrilling tone of her voice confessed
her emotion. 'The verdict of acquittal
was merely a doom to perpetual remorse.
"A life for a life," was cried to me from even
the day-break cheeping of the birds. I
thought to make atonement by fasting and
prayer: I hoped for it in attending the
stricken&mdash;walking hand-in-hand with disease.
On stormy nights I fancied I might save some
drowning soul from wreck; earn an innocent
life at the cost of my own; I was ready&mdash;craving
of God the hour and the opportunity,
but it never came. I have knelt and starved,
I have nursed the sick to health, I have
rescued a child from the depths, and yet
I live!'</p>

<p>"I clutched her gown, kissed it, abjured
her to leave her theories of atonement with
Heaven, and trust her future and its serenity
to me. But she put me aside.</p>

<p>"'Oh, Aubrey, be merciful&mdash;spare me all
you can, for I am like a pilgrim who faints in
sight of the Great Road. I know now that it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
is not the pulse of life, but the colour and the
scent of it that make one's sacrifice. I
believe that every guilty soul must have his
moment of high opportunity&mdash;of expiation,
and this is mine. You are brave, you are
great, you are generous. Shall you tempt me&mdash;and
stay; or will you save me&mdash;and go?'"</p>

<p>Poor Yeldham's voice broke to a hoarse
whisper, and I laid a sympathetic hand upon
his knee.</p>

<p>"And you, Aubrey, you went?"</p>

<p>"I am here," he answered, with a groan
that was more pitiful than tears.</p>

<h2>For Love or Science?</h2>

<div class="poem"><p>
"This morn a throstle piped to me,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">''Tis time that mates were wooed and won&mdash;</span><br />
The daffodils are on the lea.'"<br />
</p></div>


<p>There is always a store of benevolence and
magnanimity in the heart that beats at an
altitude of nearly four feet from the ground.
Wit, wisdom, and energy may go pit-a-pat
"at the double" on lower levels, but great
soul&egrave;dness and probity only come to their
perfection in a steadier region.</p>

<p>Beyond these last-quoted virtues Ralph
Danby had few. He was rather lethargic
and decidedly clumsy. His six-feet-three of
flesh and blood was knotty with muscle, but,
in the garments of the polite, the muscularity
showed like adipose tissue and spoilt him.
In feature he was pronounced perfect.</p>

<p>"Perfect as regenerate man can well be,"
raved a lady artist, who, before he had been
in Hampstead a week, had implored him to
pose for a painting of early Scandinavian
classicism. He wore a Vandyke beard&mdash;not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
because he liked it, but to avoid the casualties
of his native clumsiness, which made shaving
as farcical as Heidelberg duelling&mdash;and
permitted its amber waves to roam caressingly
close to his chin with a negligence that was
the more graceful because unstudied.</p>

<p>At first, when it became known that young
Dr Danby intended stepping into his father's
practice, Hampstead resented it. Cabinet
Councils of "tabbies," assembling over their
postprandial Bohea, declared they would none
of him. A retired Army doctor, forsooth!
What would become of their nervous ailments,
their specially feminine disorders? If they
had the finger-ache, he would be bound to
suggest amputation; if liver or neuralgia, he
would insist on active employment&mdash;those
were the only formul&aelig; known to regimental
sawbones, poor benighted things!</p>

<p>But when he came, when it saw the benign
blue eyes and lordly physique of the new
practitioner, the feline chorus changed its
note, while neuralgia, <i>migraine</i>, and other
indefinite and not unbecoming disorders
became quite epidemical in his neighbourhood.
Only a few daring persons ventured to harbour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
opinions in opposition to the <i>vox populi</i>, and
those speedily argued themselves ignorant or
prejudiced, or both.</p>

<p>There existed perhaps but one person of his
acquaintance who was absolutely indifferent to
the impression created in his new surroundings&mdash;the
one and only person for whose goodwill
Ralph Danby had ever cared. He had known
her at Gibraltar, a laughing, rosy bride,
brought out by the senior Major, a man
almost double her years. But that seemed
ages ago. The Major had been gathered
to his fathers, and Mrs Cameron, with
her baby girl, to the great regret of the
regiment, had returned to the vicinity, if
not to the care, of her parents in Maida
Vale.</p>

<p>It was this departure, though it would
have surprised him had he been told so,
that inspired Ralph Danby with the notion
that Army doctoring was a bore. He came
to the conclusion that real work was all he
wanted. What a field was open in metropolitan
life with its suffering and pain for a
man's labours&mdash;a man who was otherwise good
for nothing! And then the reward&mdash;the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
smiles of the relieved&mdash;that existed always,
when other satisfaction failed.</p>

<p>He realised he was down on his luck, but
diagnosed no further, and sent in his papers.
Farewell dinners followed, and the mess tried
to carry him round the table at the risk of
collective apoplexy (for he was a huge
favourite in every sense of the word), then
the <i>Peninsula</i> weighed anchor, and Gibraltar
saw him no more.</p>

<p>It was some time, however, after taking
over his new work that he ventured to call on
Mrs Cameron. He respected her widowhood;
he feared the renewal of his acquaintance
might revive unhappy recollections; but he
went at last.</p>

<p>He was pathetically nervous when introduced
into the tiny drawing-room where
Ph&#339;be sat alone. But the moment he heard
her rippling laughter he was reassured. The
room was small, and Ralph was big and
clumsy. In his advance one of those Algerian
tables, so admirably constructed to bark the
shins or bang the knees of unsuspecting
mortals, gave way before him and scattered
its <i>bric-&agrave;-brac</i> far and wide.  This trifling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
incident served to put him on his old footing
at once, and in fact to establish his identity,
for Danby's reputation for wreckage had been
universal as well as costly.</p>

<p>"At it again, you see, Mrs Cameron!"
exclaimed he, as he hastened to right the
impediment. "Allow me. I am so sorry.
Allow me!" he gasped, while grovelling with
her on the floor in search of some errant
trinket which had rolled into space. She
"laughed a merry laugh and said a sweet
say" of forgiveness, while he noted a transient
blush on her downy cheek. He was not a
vain man, but he harboured a tiny wonder
whether it had been born at sight of him or
of the mere exertion of stooping.</p>

<p>"I have a practice quite near here," he
volunteered aloud. "It was the stooping,"
decided the inward mentor regretfully.</p>

<p>"How curious!"</p>

<p>He did not think it so, but agreed.</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> strange. My father is old, and he
was quite pleased to retire when he found me
fit for the berth. I thought life at Gib
awfully monotonous, and was glad enough to
throw it up."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>He had not complained before Ph&#339;be
Cameron left, but the question of his sentiments
did not come under discussion. They
talked of old friends a little scrappily and
with some constraint&mdash;so much had happened
since they had met, and numerous recollections
had to be skipped&mdash;until his hostess asked:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Would you like to see my wee Ph&#339;be?
She is growing wonderfully. She is nearly
two years old now!"</p>

<p>Her voice sank with an inflexion of sorrow.
The age of her child recalled the long blank
which occupied the centre of her lifetime's
sheet.</p>

<p>The big man's heart thrilled with pity.
He longed to open his wide, protecting arms
and fold the fragile creature to his breast;
she seemed so sweet, so brave, yet so lonely.</p>

<p>But he answered bluntly enough:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Produce the youngster. I suppose she'll
call me 'Dot Dandy' as the other kids used
to!"</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be was absent for a few moments, and
then returned with a toddling article, half
embroidery, half flesh, with cheeks like apples,
and eyes wide with youthful criticism.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is Doctor Danby," introduced her
parent, lifting the child and placing her on the
guest's capacious knee, though still supporting
the tiny waist with an assuring hand.</p>

<p>He and the juvenile scanned each other
carefully. The grey eyes, the bronze curls,
and rosy mouth&mdash;they were the exact presentments
of her mother. He stooped and kissed
them one by one.</p>

<p>Before an outsider he would have been for
ever compromised, but fond mammas can see
nothing extraordinary in any affectionate
demonstration towards their offspring!</p>

<p>"Who am I, Ph&#339;be?" asked he, dwelling
tenderly on the name shared alike by parent
and child.</p>

<p>"Ow is Dot Dandy," was the lisped reply.
"Mammy, is Dot Dandy nice?"</p>

<p>Mrs Cameron hurriedly lifted the loquacious
imp from its impromptu perch. Again
"Dot" noticed a delicious flush on the transparent
cheek, and his heart leaped within
him.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" sneered the inward mentor again,
"the lassie is substantial&mdash;too substantial for
any woman to carry without colouring!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mammy, is Dot Dandy nice?" clamoured
Ph&#339;be minor again.</p>

<p>Her mother took the precaution of ringing
for the nurse before replying.</p>

<p>"Yes, darling. Very nice."</p>

<p>That time she <i>did</i> blush.  Ralph could
have sworn it!</p>

<p>How he reached home he never knew. The
biggest men are the largest fools sometimes.
His enormous heart drew its own pattern of
her perfections, and coloured it with her
beauty round and about. Her reflections of
him never extended beyond the locality of her
brain. He did not look half smart out of
uniform&mdash;was awkward as ever, but kind-hearted,
and her baby liked him! If it
were ill, he would be the person to send
for. But Ph&#339;be must be taught not to
chatter! Had it been anyone else but
Dot&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>Danby's coachman, when not cogitating on
the off-chances suggested by "straight tips"
from stablemen in the mews, used to puzzle
himself in the days which followed at the
frequency of the doctor's visits to the tiny
house in Maida Vale. He became conversant<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
with the pattern of the window curtains, and
began to cultivate a lively interest in the
headgear of the "superior young person" who
wheeled Miss Cameron's go-cart. As a
reward of his attentions, the "superior young
person," whose encyclop&aelig;dic qualities were
unbounded, certified to a fact he had long
suspected, that there was absolutely no
sickness in the establishment!</p>

<p>But Ralph Danby was happily unconscious
of the delicate supervision of man and maid,
and pursued the even tenor of his way in a
delightful state of beatitude till one day he
overstepped the bounds of public thoroughfare
and found himself face to face with a warning
to trespassers. In fact, he made an ass of
himself and proposed.</p>

<p>Without rhyme or reason he placed his six-foot-three
of cumbersome manhood at the
disposal of a woman from whom he afterwards
confessed he had never received the smallest
encouragement. She had certainly never
objected to his continual presence, but, to
those who have known each other in a garrison
town where daily meetings and calls are
common, visits are not noted with the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
importance as metropolitan formalities of like
description.</p>

<p>Mrs Cameron had not yet returned to
society, and consequently cultivated few
acquaintances. Her intimates called as
frequently as Ralph, whose arrival was never
objectless. Sometimes there was a doll to be
delivered to Ph&#339;be minor; occasionally he
produced tickets for some lecture on infancy
or education; now and then he brought music
which he especially wished to hear (he could
recognise "God Save the Queen" if played at
the end of a programme); and once he had
ventured to offer flowers! But the quick
march came to an abrupt halt through his own
folly. Because one morning he found her
with a complexion more like a rose petal than
usual, because the birds made a perfect din of
song outside, and the spring sun seemed to
pour through every crack and cranny and
say, "Winter is past," he thought her heart
must be as love-flushed as his own. Always
downright&mdash;blunt some people said&mdash;he
invaded where angels might have feared to
tread.</p>

<p>"Mrs Cameron&mdash;Ph&#339;be&mdash;I love you. Will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
you marry me? Will you let me make you
happy again?"</p>

<p>Two dove-grey eyes blinked wide with
amazement; then, seeing the reality of his
emotion, she stepped back a pace, and seemed
to freeze as she stood.</p>

<p>The birds sounded discordantly; the sunshine
lost all its warmth&mdash;it was but a winter
gleam after all; the rose-bloom of her cheek
changed to deadly pallor. Big man as he
was, he grew giddy as he looked. He knew
at once the magnitude of his vanity and his
mistake, and cursed himself for having spoken.</p>

<p>"Doctor Danby, I&mdash;I&mdash;you do me honour.
I thank you very much, but oh! why did you
spoil our friendship with such folly?"</p>

<p>"Folly? To love you? I have never done
a wiser thing in my life!"</p>

<p>"Pray do not speak of love. You know&mdash;you
must know&mdash;that word to me is dead for
ever!"</p>

<p>"But some day, in the future, you
might&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My future, Doctor Danby, belongs to
my child. I shall never allow any interest
to come before my love for her. Will you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
understand this, and forgive and forget to-day
as though it had never been?"</p>

<p>He was not a really vain man, or her frigid
words, her rejection of his love, would have
sent him from the house angered and mortified,
never to return. But he was large-souled and
childishly tender of heart, and thought, even
in his disappointment, that, in her unprotected
state, she might at times have need of him.</p>

<p>Because his demand had exceeded his
deserts, and because he had received a merited
snub for his rashness, there was no reason, he
argued, that she should be deprived the right
of using him as her friend.</p>

<p>He smiled a sickly assent and extended his
hand.</p>

<p>"Good-bye, and I may come and see you
sometimes still? It is not as if there were
anyone else&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mrs Cameron interrupted hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Please do, and we will never reopen this
subject again!"</p>

<p>"Never again!" swore poor Danby as he
left the house&mdash;and he meant it.</p>

<p>In his own sanctum he conned over every
speech of hers and found the interview had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
been bald to desolation. Not one green blade
of sympathy even had she given to cheer the
dreary wilderness of his life. She had wished
to keep him as her friend, certainly; but that
in itself was a dubious compliment. Had she
cared for him ever so little, and felt bound
by duty for her child's sake to sacrifice love,
she would have avoided painful chances of
meeting.</p>

<p>"She has evidently no fear of falling in love
with me," groaned Ralph to himself. "I
am not even sufficiently interesting to be
dangerous."</p>

<p>This rankled for some time. He continued
on his daily rounds, endeavouring, if possible,
to avoid passing through the street in which
his frosty idol dwelt. With dreary, lustreless
eyes he received the blandishments of the
feminine throng which had elevated him to
popularity; with tired, joyless heart he buried
himself in his lonely home after the treadmill
hours were over. Only some exceptional case
of suffering or technical interest had power
to rouse him. He was but happy when
ministering to the physical pain of others; if
possible, he would have shared it. In mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
trouble the absolute prick and smart of bodily
injury seems a welcome inconvenience, for at
least it admits of hope, the continued hope of
recovery, to give impetus to life. He was
neither mawkish nor sentimental&mdash;his years of
scientific training had pruned such tendencies;
but the inborn sympathy with his fellow-men
which had prompted him to the choice of
medicine as a career permeated every tissue of
his medical knowledge and supplemented a
powerful element of healing peculiarly its
own. He had been ever ready to throw heart
and soul into any case of interest or alarm, but
now his patients found him more than ever
devoted. They did not know that in their
service alone the heart's blood of the man was
kept from an&aelig;sthesia. For nearly a month
Ralph Danby avoided the house in Mervan
Street; then with the inconsistency symbolic
of great minds, he decided to go there at once.
He counselled himself that half a loaf was
better than no bread, and came rightly to
the conclusion that if he intended calling
again, the more he postponed the ordeal
the more impossible would be the resumption
of the old relations which had existed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
so happily before he had made a fool of
himself.</p>

<p>On the doorstep he trembled&mdash;absolutely
trembled (he who, in Egypt, had bandaged
wound after wound, while bullets peppered
the air with their metal hail)&mdash;but once in her
presence, her serene composure was infectious,
he was himself again, and almost forgot his
last unhappy visit and the miserable interregnum
of mental nothingness from which he
had suffered. He might have been uneasy or
constrained, but her calm suavity left him no
opportunity. About her manner there was
no spark of vanity, no simpering nor restraint&mdash;she
was merely a well-bred young hostess
entertaining an intimate friend.</p>

<p>In novels heroines are credited with the
exhibition of complex emotions on the smallest
provocation, but women of breeding in the
nineteenth century are too good actresses to
hang their hearts on their sleeves without
exceptional cause. So Ralph Danby's little
brougham came and went as of yore, and
only in the solitary evenings, when reason
unprejudiced criticised his actions, did he
realise that again was he building a palace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of Eros, and again its foundation was nothing
but sand!</p>

<p>One evening, in the midst of his mental
accusations, came a note:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Please come soon. Ph&#339;be seems very ill.&mdash;P. C.</p></div>

<p>He hailed a hansom and was off in a
moment.</p>

<p>The child was asleep in her crib, and Mrs
Cameron watched uneasily by her side. The
flushed face, hurrying pulse, the dry skin, and
spasmodic breathing showed signs of fever.
There were cases of diphtheria about, and he
looked grave. But he decided to cause no
unnecessary anxiety, and promised to return
later. Then there was no concealing it; great
care, he said, must be exercised, as the child
was young and not over-strong. He put
his opinion in that form to avoid being an
alarmist, though the symptoms of the disease
were unfavourable, and he dreaded the worst.
But his own hope was so great that it
tempered his report with consolation, for he
had not the heart to warn Ph&#339;be's mother
of his fears.</p>

<p>After hours of anxious watching he could
not but own to himself that no progress was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
made, and that the crisis must be awaited with
dread. Should he tell her? Dared he? In
front of him lay the probably dying little
creature that was first in her life&mdash;before
himself, before anything. Should she perish,
there would be no barrier in the world
between them; Mrs Cameron would have no
duty but to herself!</p>

<p>A warm flush underlay his features&mdash;not
the flush of pride or of satisfaction; it was the
dye of shame for thoughts which placed
himself and his egoistic desires before the life
of the innocent being whose fate seemed to lie
in his hands. It lasted not a moment, for he
rose and left the house with a face quite ashen
grey, whence all the light and fire of youth
had faded. He was not long absent, for he
had secured a passing hansom and paid a
doubled fare for doubled speed.</p>

<p>He found Mrs Cameron alone with the
child, while the nurse, worn out and weary,
dozed in an adjacent room. Little Ph&#339;be,
who, earlier in the day, had been restless to
a frightful degree, flinging about her waxen,
chubby arms distractedly in the effort to gain
breath, now lay almost motionless.  Her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
mother, little experienced in any phase of
illness, imagined that some slight improvement
had taken place, but Ralph Danby
knew better. The dull bluish pallor of the
hitherto rosy skin; the rapid pulsation and
agonised breathing; the feeble, sad croak
that could not develop force enough for a
cry&mdash;all told him there was no time to be
lost.</p>

<p>He hastily opened the case for which he
had journeyed home, and produced a small
silver tube.</p>

<p>Mrs Cameron watched his movements with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?"</p>

<p>She was standing near the crib, midway
between it and a table whereon he had
deposited the case. As her eyes met his she
read, by an extraordinary intuition which
comes to most of us when reason fails, that
he purposed some extreme course of action.</p>

<p>"What are you going to do?" she reiterated,
somewhat sharply.</p>

<p>"I must give our little patient relief&mdash;instant
relief&mdash;by means of this," he answered,
hastily. She seemed to be wasting time with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
questions when every moment was precious.
Still she stood motionless in front of him.</p>

<p>"How?" she persisted, in a voice so hollow
that he could scarcely recognise it.</p>

<p>"I cannot explain now. You must trust
me."</p>

<p>"How?" she cried, imperatively. "I will
know." A light was dawning on her. She
was recalling a case of which she had read in
some old paper where the doctor lost his life
to save the patient.</p>

<p>Danby frowned slightly, and his face looked
worn and old. He was unaccustomed to be
doubted or to have his authority questioned.</p>

<p>"If you will know, I shall insert this in the
throat," he replied, deliberately advancing
towards the cot, "and remove the mucus by
suction."</p>

<p>"But you might catch the disease?"</p>

<p>"Possibly."</p>

<p>"You might&mdash;you might die?"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>He was bending towards the child, and
gently rubbing the tube with his handkerchief.
With a sudden movement she flung
herself between him and the crib, and placed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
her outstretched palms against his broad
chest.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;shall&mdash;not!"</p>

<p>Her agonised touch, the expression of her
wild, troubled eyes, made Dot's heart thump
within him, but his face showed no sign.</p>

<p>With seeming severity he clasped her wrists
and drew her to the adjoining dressing-room.</p>

<p>"It is a matter of life and death&mdash;your
child's. I dared not tell you how serious&mdash;I
hoped to save you alarm. Now there is no
time to spare."</p>

<p>With that he returned to the room, closed
the door, and locked it, leaving her in a
passion of tears on the other side. Then he
rang for the nurse, and proceeded.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Though at first his very soul seemed shaken
with suppressed emotion, in a few seconds
the sight of the infant's sufferings, its near
approach to suffocation, overwhelmed all
remembrance of his own personality, and
restored the equilibrium. One thought of
the woman, and his frame had throbbed and
shivered like the forest trees in March;
another, the greater, nobler thought of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
science, his sacred mission at the hands of
his Maker, and the trembling fingers grew
steady.</p>

<p>With accuracy and judgment he inserted
the shining channel into the windpipe of the
sufferer; with patience and deliberation he
held the end of the instrument in his mouth
and sucked!</p>

<p>And all the while from the inner room came
the sound of sobs&mdash;the passionate wail of the
woman who had betrayed herself, who stood
self-accused of neglecting her child. He heard
the grievous sound as he strained the poisonous
mucus from the tiny throat and breathed the
death-laden air into his lungs. He knew that
he swayed on the bridge between life and
eternity; that possibly&mdash;nay, probably&mdash;he
should never hear the sweet enchantment of
her voice again; that if he should die it must
be without so much as a pressure from her
hand; and yet the great heart never wavered,
but beat evenly like the pulse of some grand
cathedral clock, which, spite of marriage chime
or funeral knell, pursues its steadfast purpose
for ever.</p>

<p>At last the work was over, and its reward,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the free respiration of the little sufferer, was
assured. Then a feeling of dizziness crept
over his brain, and he hastened home, but not
before summoning his partner to relieve him.</p>

<p>When Doctor Davis arrived, he learnt from
the nurse and Mrs Cameron what had taken
place. He was a practical, prosaic person,
cumbered with a delicate wife and up-growing
children, and censured Danby's conduct as
foolhardy in the extreme.</p>

<p>"Is he bound to catch it?" asked Ph&#339;be,
with concern.</p>

<p>"Most certainly," replied the physician,
scowling. He liked Ralph, and thought him
much too sound a fellow to be lost through
idiocy. "I believe there have been cases to
the contrary&mdash;some solitary exceptions."</p>

<p>"But even then," pursued she, anxiously,
"he need not die? He will recover?"</p>

<p>"Ten to one against it," said the doctor,
bluntly, quite unconscious that the ghastly
pallor of his questioner was due to more than
weary watching by her child.</p>

<p>But Danby did recover. His magnificent
constitution pulled him through in a manner
little short of the miraculous. Perhaps hope<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
had some occult healing power unknown to
those who watched and tended him.</p>

<p>At the end of six weeks the burly "Dot"
was himself again, and once more made his
way to the little house in Mervan Street in
glad expectation. A terrible disappointment
awaited him. Ph&#339;be major was not at
home! Ph&#339;be minor, however, executed
gleeful saltations in honour of his arrival.</p>

<p>"How is 'oo, Dot Dandy? Twite, twite
well? Ph&#339;be pray Dod every day make Dot
well!"</p>

<p>The big man stooped and kissed the tiny
prattler, and thus avoided the necessity for
speech. His heart seemed to have risen in
his throat, and made a huge lump there.</p>

<p>Hurriedly taking his departure, he determined
to call another day, but though he went
again and again, it was with no better luck.
Then he understood that Mrs Cameron's
repeated absences were not the result of accident,
but of design. She had been kind in her
daily inquiries after him, but now that he had
recovered, she was decided they should not
meet.</p>

<p>A few days later the child had a feverish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
cold, and to his chagrin he heard that Doctor
Davis had been sent for. That made it quite
evident he was not wanted. He made no
effort to go, but smarted under the sense of
injury. His better reason argued that as she
had intentionally broken with him, she could
not demand his attendance on the infant without
risk of unavoidable meeting. But why
had she so behaved? Had he not saved her
child, the light of her life, the aim of her
future? Had he not determined studiously to
forget her accidental show of anxiety for him,
prompted by ignorance of the child's immediate
danger? Why had she asked after him
daily? Why had little knots of flowers been
left by bairn and nurse, and why, ah, why!
had the wee lips uttered a prayer for him?</p>

<p>"Perhaps the child had acted of her own
impulse," sighed his modesty.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she had been so taught," panted
his hope.</p>

<p>At last he determined to end the estrangement
or let friendship perish in the attempt.
He wanted nothing but her forgiveness; that
he felt he deserved.</p>

<p>He knew every afternoon at five the nurse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
was relieved by Mrs Cameron, who watched in
the nursery while the babe slept. That hour,
therefore, was chosen for his visit. He
mounted the stairs two at a time and rapped
at the familiar door. There was no answer.
He turned the handle and entered.</p>

<p>Ph&#339;be major sat at the open window idle.
She was reading the picture promise of the
clouds. Ph&#339;be minor in a cot slept rosily in
the far corner of the room.</p>

<p>"Good afternoon," he whispered softly, in
order not to disturb the little slumberer.</p>

<p>Mrs Cameron extended a hand, but no
smile greeted him. She scarcely turned from
her study of the skies. Poor Danby's heart
felt sore and heavy laden. He asked a few
trivialities regarding the invalid's health, and
each query received an appropriate reply&mdash;nothing
more.</p>

<p>He had taken a seat facing hers by
the window, but even then only a profile
view of the face he loved was accorded
him.</p>

<p>At length he could endure no longer.</p>

<p>"Mrs Cameron, I regret having come
instead of Davis. He was engaged. I had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
no idea I should be so unwelcome. Have I
offended you irremediably?"</p>

<p>"No. Yes!" she corrected.</p>

<p>"How?"</p>

<p>He bent forward to induce her gaze to rest
on him, but was foiled.</p>

<p>"If you will not tell me, how can I make
amends? Was it because I locked you from
your own room?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>He noticed the tight grasp of her soft
fingers against the window-sill. She was not
as callous as she wished to appear.</p>

<p>"Was it because I treated the child without
your leave?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Her frame shook slightly, and two crystal
drops which she was too proud to wipe away
stood in her eyes.</p>

<p>Very gently he covered her hand with his
own great one; very softly he whispered in a
voice he could scarcely steady:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Was it because I seemed ungrateful for
the little love you offered me?"</p>

<p>The two tears rolled down her cheeks and
dropped upon his wrist.  With quivering<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
mouth she strove to frame what her face
confessed would be a lie.</p>

<p>He no longer hesitated, but caught her to
his breast and crushed the naughty falsehood
with his lips.</p>

<p>How long the operation would have lasted
it is impossible to guess, for two shining eyes
set in slumber-flushed cheeks peered suddenly
from the distant cot, and a prattling voice,
unabashed and lusty, shouted:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Tiss me too&mdash;Dot Dandy!"</p>

<p>The difficulty of apprehending the female
character is well-nigh insurmountable.
Woman has been called chameleon, weathercock,
enigma; but an enigma has a solution
which may be reached by patience or accident,
a weathercock will confess the bent of
the wind for however short a space, and
the colour of a chameleon can be periodically
proved by its dietary. But woman&mdash;she
is a reiterating question, an argument
sans crux, a volume with uncut leaves
dotted about through the most exciting
chapters. Without the right clue you must
dip and skip, now pricked, now irritated, till
you approach a frenzy bordering on madness.
For you like to know the sort of creature you
are dealing with&mdash;a painter especially, since
his fame hangs on his knowledge&mdash;hence
these ruminations round Betty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>Betty? you say&mdash;do we not all know her?
Does not her dimpled face peer out of the
weekly papers, and do not their columns
expose and magnify every little detail of
her life&mdash;her fads, her fancies, and her
follies? Cannot we see her night after
night whisking her mazy skirts in the limelight,
and opening the carnation folds of her
lips to patter enchanting nonsense and pout
promises brittle as pie crust? Dear little
Betty! How her twinkling feet make
merry, light as sea-foam frothing on shells;
how our pulses throb and dance in pace
with hers; how our ears dote on the
fragile, cooing tones of her dainty voice as
it coquettes with banalities, flirts with the
very bars of melody that silly men have
tried to make witty and pretty. But the
prettiness and wittiness are Betty's; do we
not all know that? Do we not know that
the shiver of the violins is only quaint
when Betty shudders at the whisper of a
kiss, that the cyclone of strings and wind
fades exquisitely, "like a rose in aromatic
pain," simply because Betty, our whimsical
dear, chooses to sigh for having shuddered?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
And when at last she cries, to think she
sighs for that at which she shuddered, we
all clap our hands to splitting&mdash;not, oh, not
at the music, but in wild collective rapture
over the vagaries of our Betty!</p>

<p>In this way I thought I knew her every
trick and wile and whim, till I came to
paint her picture, till one after another my
charcoal lines were flicked from the canvas,
and I succumbed to that paralysing sense
of total defeat which is almost always the
punishment of swollen ambition. What was
wrong? I asked myself. What had I missed?
The pose, the expression, the throb of motion?
Weeks passed&mdash;then I worked again, made a
new study, and consulted my cousin Laura.
She knew something of dancing, and was at
that time practising ballet steps, a necessary
accompaniment&mdash;so she had been told&mdash;to her
deb&ucirc;t in comic opera.</p>

<p>"The face is perfection," she said. "The
little droop in the left eye&mdash;she must have
been born winking&mdash;and the upward curve at
the corner of the lip, they couldn't be
improved."</p>

<p>I shook my head. Laura's verdict was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
unsatisfactory. The human mind so often
demands an opinion when it really wants a
looking-glass.</p>

<p>"Perhaps if I could get more action&mdash;more
of the warmth which goes with
action&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"It would affect the flesh tint, certainly.
You should see me pirouetting at Dupres'&mdash;a
peony isn't in it."</p>

<p>"I should like to see you," I said, jumping
at a probable solution of my difficulties,
"particularly in daylight. One gets better to
the core of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"With women," Laura interrupted, "it's
safest to reject the core."</p>

<p>"Cynic. You admit the downiest have the
hardest hearts&mdash;like peaches, eh?"</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be cynical. You can
avoid the hard part. It is better than
choosing the human plantains that have none:
smooth, soapy, insipid things, they clog in no
time."</p>

<p>"But pears eat straight through&mdash;sweet to
the pip," I said, gazing quizzically at my
latest sketch. "Betty is a pear."</p>

<p>Laura laughed generously.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>"Foolish boy, keep your illusions. You
can clean your brushes in them. Degas
saw wonderful things in his models&mdash;things
hidden from the vulgar eye."</p>

<p>"I am glad you mentioned Degas. I
mean to see more than this Betty of the
Ballet. Take me to your class."</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't dance in the class. I have
a private lesson when the girls are gone.
You can come this afternoon at four."</p>

<p>We made a long journey on the top of an
omnibus to a hole somewhere in Lambeth.
Squalor appeared to grope under railway
arches, and penury to moan through flapping
fragments of clothing that swung at intervals
along the narrow paths, behind rows
of second-hand furniture and groups of dishevelled
infants.</p>

<p>"A choice locality," I growled.</p>

<p>"Cheap," exclaimed Laura. "When you
put your shoulder to the wheel you mustn't
mind greasing your jacket."</p>

<p>She was a plucky girl&mdash;glad, like many
others, to grasp the only opportunity of
self-support. My uncle, a Cheshire parson,
had died peacefully, leaving four girls and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
six boys with bucolic appetites to the
charge of Providence.</p>

<p>"Here we are at last," my cousin said,
leaping down with agility, and hardly
stopping the omnibus for her exit.</p>

<p>We alighted almost in front of a quaint
building which looked like an excrescence&mdash;a
wart&mdash;on the visage of a dilapidated chapel.
Laura led the way up a garden in size somewhat
larger than a postage-stamp, where two
heartseases, sole invaders of the desolate
gravel, tried to blink golden eyes through a
canopy of dust. The door was opened by a
youth who mingled an air of proprietorship
with the aspect of a waiter at a third-rate
caf&eacute;. He waved a hand to rooms, or rather
cabins, on the right, through which Laura led
me. Cabin the first contained a dining table
and a fossil piano utilised as shelf for sundries
and sideboard; cabin the second, apparently a
sleeping chamber, held a bed, dressing table,
and a diminutive bracket on which might have
stood a hand basin; while cabin the third&mdash;little
more than a wooden box papered with
promiscuous remnants of a decorator's stock&mdash;stored
a plank upraised by volunteer legs<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
enlisted from haphazard sources, a basin, a bottle
of cloudy water, and a cracked wall mirror.</p>

<p>There Laura slipped off her walking shoes,
and announced her intention to make a change
of toilette.</p>

<p>I forthwith escaped through the further
door, and found myself in a large, bare room,
facing a middle-aged man, who was evidently
the dancing master, M. Dupres.</p>

<p>I explained my presence and my interest in
the ballet.</p>

<p>"I am accompanying my cousin, Miss
Lorimer"&mdash;this was the stage name by which
she was known&mdash;"in order to paint the pose
of one of my sitters. I want more vibrating
actuality, and hope to sketch it here."</p>

<p>"Mais certainement&mdash;of course. Ze beauty
of ze human form is never so fine as when it
moves to my vish. You vill see."</p>

<p>Laura entered in a short, fan-pleated frock
with black silk knickerbockers, and lacy frills
shrouding the knees. Her silken hose and
shiny pumps make her already graceful as
she chass&eacute;d by way of experiment across the
bare boards from the orange-toothed piano
at one end to the camp chairs at the other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
The ballet-master made his way to a small
conservatory&mdash;a hospital for effete bulbs and
straggling, deformed geraniums&mdash;and snatching
up a watering-can laid the dust which
already began to thicken the air.</p>

<p>Then operations began. To me they were
deeply interesting, because Betty's face and
form were continually before my eyes, and the
one thing wanting to make my work a
chef-d'&#339;uvre was, I hoped, on the verge of
discovery. Laura placed herself in an
attitude, glanced at her instructor, who had
armed himself with a fiddle, and with its first
tones commenced a series of evolutions.
Sketch-book in hand, I followed her
movements, now noting a six-step shuffle
straight a-down the length of the boards;
now sketching the action of her arms, which,
balancing that of the feet, swayed inversely
with every bend of the knees. Then came an
etherealised milkmaid step that might have
been termed an arm akimbo gallop had not the
two wrists been pressed abnormally forward
against the waist, with their pink palms
glowing outwards. In this pose poor Laura's
limbs looked obdurate as sawdust, while<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
Betty's had bent like wax to the will of the
modeller. Meanwhile, the fiddle fluttered,
and the master now and then exemplified the
grace of any particular attitude he desired.
You could observe his beautiful build, the
symmetry of every movement, despite the
impediment of two gouty-looking feet encased
in cloth-covered boots of original design. His
features were certainly distinguished, and the
trimness of his prematurely blanched hair
made a curious contrast to the general
dilapidation of the surroundings. His poses,
one quickly following the other, were all
picturesque. With every turn of the head, or
bend of a knee, or stretch of an arm, some
fresh revelation of physical equipoise delighted
the eye.</p>

<p>Laura went through various new movements
of a Spanish Carmen-like fandango with head
uplifted and a bravura pout of the chin,
after which we preceded her through the
dressing-room, where she was left to readjust
her walking dress. A sense of disappointment
weighed on me. All these attitudes, all these
evolutions I had seen in their perfection
through the medium of Betty. No grace of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
motion could equal hers, no actuality portrayed
by another could be half as exquisite as even
the baldest reminiscence of her.</p>

<p>On the wall of the little bed-chamber where
M. Dupres courteously accompanied me were
many photographs, faded but still recognisable,
of himself dressed in tights or other theatrical
frippery. He took evident pleasure in watching
my appreciation of the curious attitudes in
which&mdash;to show off in their fullest perfection
the lithe muscles and magnificent symmetry
of his agile frame&mdash;he had been portrayed.</p>

<p>"You must have danced a great deal?" I
questioned, seeing that some remark was
required of me.</p>

<p>"Danced!" he said, lifting his eyes to
the smudgy ceiling. "Yes, it is feefteen
year ago, but I remember it like jesterday.
All overe in vone moment; a coup de fouet
ve call it."</p>

<p>I begged for an explanation.</p>

<p>"I vas ze first&mdash;ze very first. One leap
into ze air I could do&mdash;so high," he said,
lifting his hand descriptively; "a leap zat
no vone vould dare&mdash;my fortune vas made.
Pupils came from all ze countries to learn<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
from me some leetle 'pas,' but zere vas no
time. Zen, vone night zere came a king
to see me&mdash;me, ze king of ze dance&mdash;ah! I
may say zat now it is all gone! I danced;
ze air vas no lighter zan I ... ze
people shouted, zey called, zey encored.
Again I danced, high, high, higher, and
zen&mdash;crack!"</p>

<p>He brought his two hands together with a
sharp click. His face was convulsed with
emotion, and presently he took a handkerchief
from his pocket and wiped the damp from his
brow.</p>

<p>"Yes," he continued, "it is feefteen year&mdash;but
to me it is to-day. Zere&mdash;in my leg was
a break"&mdash;he pointed to the place a little
above his ankle and below the calf. "You
could put a fingere into it&mdash;that vone muscle
vas my fortune&mdash;it vas gone&mdash;split in vone
moment."</p>

<p>His sad eyes stared blankly out from the
cracked unclean window as though reviewing
a vast panorama of his early years.</p>

<p>"How sad; terrible! Is this a common
accident?" I inquired of him.</p>

<p>"Common? Yes, ze coup de fouet; but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
zis vas vorse. For long I lay in bed, my
brain made mad to know zat all vas overe, zat
all vas lost. Zey offered me half vage to
teach, but no&mdash;not vere I had been ze first&mdash;ze
very first. I left England and my friends,
I hoped for evere."</p>

<p>"Was that not foolish?" I asked, viewing
the greasy curtains and other surrounding
evidences of poverty.</p>

<p>"Voolish? Ah, ve are all vools vhen ve
love. I had loved: she vas almost mine, but
she vas too young, a child dancer of feefteen
summers. So sveet, so beautiful. She learnt
from me my art, every jeste, every perfection.
She vould have been my vife, my queen&mdash;but
after zis, I ran. Vhen my senses came I knew
that I could be no more rich&mdash;only a poor
dead dog in her vay. For zis I fled ze country.
I came back after feefteen year, no longer ze
great Salvador, but plain M. Dupres&mdash;back to
hear of Betty&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Betty!" I echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes, the first dancer in London&mdash;my
leetle Betty&mdash;you have zeen her?" And
he lifted a hand to a portrait over his
pillow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span></p>

<p>I recognised with dismay the child face&mdash;the
merry smile at the corner of the lip.</p>

<p>"This is the very woman I am trying to
paint."</p>

<p>"Sapristi!" he exclaimed, and again wiped
his brow. "You vill keep my zecret? Ze
years of zacrifice, let them not be known to
her." His face was wrinkled and livid with
anxiety.</p>

<p>"Your confidence is sacred; I am honoured
by it," I said, extending a hand, for Laura
just then opened the door upon us.</p>

<p>She laughed whimsically at my almost
emotional leave-taking of a total stranger,
and chaffed me about it when we got outside.</p>

<p>"I have much to be grateful for to him&mdash;to
you," I said. "My picture is almost
achieved. I may be worthy to follow at the
heels of Degas yet."</p>

<p>When Betty next came to the studio she
thought my painting was completed, and
skipped about in front of the canvas with
the genuine joy of gratified vanity.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you tell me it was done, and
I needn't have got into these," she said, lifting
the hem of her gauze skirt to her lips&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
fascinating trick which, to use her own
expression, invariably "brought down the
house."</p>

<p>I looked at the laughing row of white teeth
and thought of Dupres.</p>

<p>"You still want a touch or two. Just get
into position for one moment."</p>

<p>"You'll spoil me," she warned, jumping to
her place on the "throne," and shooting out
an ankle that would have unhinged Diogenes.</p>

<p>"Nothing could spoil you," I said gallantly,
and a paint tube levelled in the direction of
my head was the reward of my politeness.</p>

<p>"You don't aim as well as you dance.
How did you learn&mdash;at a training school, or
where?"</p>

<p>"To dance? Bah! training schools can't
teach the fine poetry of movement. They
knock the prose into you, but&mdash;but the
poetry I learnt from&mdash;O&mdash;a man who was
great in his day."</p>

<p>"Salvador?" I ventured.</p>

<p>She blushed faintly.</p>

<p>"How did you know?"</p>

<p>"You gave the cue. Salvador was the
greatest name I could think of&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span></p>

<p>"You know something of dancing, then?"</p>

<p>"Very little. I have heard he had an
accident or something that affected his
career."</p>

<p>"Yes; it turned his head. He was to
have married me, but, like all men, he was
ungrateful. He changed&mdash;changed quite
suddenly."</p>

<p>"How so?"</p>

<p>"I nursed him night and day. He had
no mother, no sister, and I thought I could
be all the world to him. Little girls are
romantic, and he was too ill to know.
Before he recovered consciousness I sent an
old woman to attend him; but one fine day,
when well enough, he bolted."</p>

<p>"Where?"</p>

<p>"Lord knows!" (Betty's language was
not Johnsonian.) "Do you think I was
going to crawl after him and grovel&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>"There is no grovelling where love levels."</p>

<p>"But it didn't level," she said, angrily, as
though the reproach stung&mdash;"it didn't level.
I would have chucked my whole future for
him: I would now, while he.... O, don't
talk of it," she exclaimed huskily, whisking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
the back of her hand across her eyes: "I
tell myself it was all for the best."</p>

<p>The tone implied a query, but I made no
answer. There were heart thrills in the air,
and my brush, pregnant with their subtle
rhythm, was travailling fast.</p>

<p>"Why don't you say it was?" she persisted.
"You know that love&mdash;real love&mdash;is worse
than handcuffs."</p>

<p>"'A cloying treacle to the wings of independence'&mdash;eh?
Keats would have been glad
of the treacle nevertheless."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. Wouldn't we just drown in it
if we could?... But, after all, I should
have been a fat lump of domesticity by now,"
she laughed, straightening her lithe limbs and
resuming her conventional smile.</p>

<p>In a moment she had become the world's
Betty again&mdash;bewitching, coy, insouciante
Betty.</p>

<p>But a tear-drop still clung to her eyelashes.</p>
